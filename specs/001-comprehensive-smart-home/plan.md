# Implementation Plan: Comprehensive Smart Home Automation System

**Branch**: `001-comprehensive-smart-home` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-comprehensive-smart-home/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
A comprehensive smart home automation system using ESP32 microcontroller and MicroPython to manage environmental monitoring (temperature/humidity), security controls (motion detection, PIR sensors), access management (RFID), safety systems (gas detection), and IoT connectivity (WiFi, MQTT, cloud database). The system integrates 8+ sensors/actuators with autonomous operation plus manual overrides for complete home automation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: MicroPython 1.20+ on ESP32 microcontroller
**Primary Dependencies**: machine, network, umqtt, urequests, DHT, SSD1306, MFRC522, NeoPixel libraries
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL cloud database, local ESP32 flash memory
**Testing**: MicroPython REPL testing, hardware simulation, live device testing
**Target Platform**: ESP32 microcontroller (KS5009 smart home kit)
**Project Type**: IoT embedded system - single microcontroller project
**Performance Goals**: Real-time sensor response <100ms, OLED refresh 1Hz, MQTT transmission <1s
**Constraints**: ESP32 RAM limitations (~520KB), WiFi connectivity required, battery backup optional
**Scale/Scope**: Single household, 8+ hardware components, 50+ automation rules, cloud data persistence

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Analysis**: The constitution template is placeholder-based with no specific constraints defined. For this embedded IoT project:

- **Embedded System Principles**: Focus on hardware integration, real-time response, and resource constraints
- **Modular Design**: Separate sensor/actuator classes, centralized automation logic, error handling
- **IoT Best Practices**: Secure connectivity, data persistence, offline capability consideration
- **Educational Standards**: Professional documentation, version control, comprehensive testing

**Gate Status**: PASS - No constitutional violations detected for embedded IoT project scope

**Structure Decision**: Embedded IoT project structure - MicroPython modules organized by hardware component with centralized automation logic

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: ✅ research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: ✅ data-model.md, ✅ /contracts/*, quickstart.md, ✅ CLAUDE.md (agent-specific file)

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - ✅ research.md generated
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - ✅ data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only) - ✅ Strategy documented
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved - Technical context fully specified
