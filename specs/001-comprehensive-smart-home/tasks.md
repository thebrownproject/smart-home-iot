# Tasks: Comprehensive Smart Home Automation System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-comprehensive-smart-home/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: MicroPython 1.20+ on ESP32, machine/network/umqtt libraries
   → Structure: Embedded IoT project with modular sensor classes
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 5 entities (EnvironmentalReading, AccessRecord, SecurityEvent, SystemState, EmergencyEvent)
   → contracts/: MQTT API, Supabase API contracts
   → research.md: 8 technical decisions with object-oriented architecture
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: ESP32 project, MicroPython dependencies, hardware validation
   → Tests: MQTT contract tests, Supabase API tests, integration scenarios
   → Core: sensor classes, automation engine, network communication
   → Integration: MQTT client, database sync, emergency protocols
   → Polish: performance validation, error handling, comprehensive testing
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different sensor modules = mark [P] for parallel
   → Shared automation engine = sequential dependencies
   → Hardware tests before software implementation
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph for embedded system constraints
7. Create parallel execution examples for independent sensor development
8. Validate completeness: All 8 user stories covered, all hardware components addressed
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files/modules, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths for MicroPython modules

## Path Conventions
- **ESP32 Project**: `src/` modules uploaded to ESP32 device
- **Tests**: `tests/` directory for validation scripts
- **Hardware**: Physical component testing and validation
- Paths assume ESP32 MicroPython structure with Thonny IDE deployment

## Phase 3.1: Setup and Hardware Validation
- [x] T001 Create ESP32 project structure with MicroPython module organization ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] T002 Initialize hardware connections and test basic I2C/GPIO functionality ✅ COMPLETED (5/6 tests passed - see notes)
- [x] T003 [P] Configure development environment with Thonny IDE and ESP32 support ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] T004 [P] Hardware validation script for all sensors in tests/hardware/test_connections.py ⚠️ NEEDS POWER MGMT UPDATE
- [x] T005 [P] WiFi connectivity test and credential management in tests/hardware/test_wifi.py ✅ COMPLETED

### Hardware Validation Status (Updated 2025-09-17)
**Overall: 5/6 components operational (83% success rate)**

✅ **Fully Operational:**
- Digital I/O: PIR motion (Pin 14), Gas sensor (Pin 23), LED control (Pin 12)
- PWM Outputs: Servo motor (Pin 13), Fan control (Pins 18/19)
- RGB LEDs: NeoPixel/SK6812 (Pin 26) - full color cycling working
- DHT11 Sensor: Temperature/humidity readings stable (Pin 17)
- Development Environment: Thonny IDE + ESP32 deployment working

✅ **Conditional Operation:**
- LCD Display: I2C communication working at address 0x27 (SDA:21, SCL:22)
- RFID Reader: I2C detected but requires power management

⚠️ **Known Issue - Power Supply Limitation:**
- **Root Cause**: ESP32 5V rail insufficient for LCD + RFID simultaneous operation
- **Current Behavior**: LCD works perfectly when RFID disconnected
- **Impact**: I2C bus appears "failed" in testing when both devices connected
- **Solutions**:
  1. External 5V power supply (recommended for production)
  2. Software power management (GPIO-controlled device power)
  3. Component sequencing (power devices on-demand)

**Development Strategy**: Continue with 5/6 working components. LCD validation successful. RFID power management to be implemented in Phase 3.4 (Core System Logic).

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files/modules, no shared dependencies
- Hardware validation must pass before software implementation
- ESP32 memory constraints require careful resource management
- All emergency protocols must function without network connectivity
- MQTT and database integration must handle network failures gracefully
- Manual override buttons must work independently of software state

## ESP32 Specific Considerations
- MicroPython modules uploaded individually via Thonny IDE
- Memory limitations require lazy loading and garbage collection
- I2C device conflicts (OLED + RFID) require careful address management
- Real-time constraints for emergency response protocols
- WiFi connectivity recovery procedures essential for IoT functionality

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From MQTT Contract**: Each MQTT topic → contract test task [P]
2. **From Supabase Contract**: Each API endpoint → contract test task [P]
3. **From Data Model**: Each entity → validation and caching logic
4. **From User Stories**: Each story → integration test [P]
5. **From Hardware**: Each component → abstraction class [P]
6. **From Research Decisions**: Each architecture decision → implementation task
