## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A homeowner wants a comprehensive smart home system that automatically manages climate comfort, provides security monitoring, controls access to their property, and ensures safety through emergency response capabilities. The system should operate autonomously while allowing manual overrides when needed, with remote monitoring capabilities for peace of mind.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the temperature rises above comfort level, **When** the sensor detects heat, **Then** the window opens automatically and displays a cooling message
2. **Given** motion is detected in the home, **When** someone enters a room, **Then** lights turn on, fan starts, and display shows welcome message
3. **Given** the PIR sensor detects movement, **When** unauthorized motion occurs, **Then** buzzer sounds and RGB lights cycle through all colors as warning
4. **Given** an authorized RFID card is presented, **When** user approaches door, **Then** door unlocks and LED shows access granted status
5. **Given** dangerous gas is detected, **When** sensor triggers, **Then** all doors and windows open, fan activates, RGB lights flash warning, and buzzer sounds emergency alert
6. **Given** gas alarm is active, **When** button one is pressed, **Then** gas alarm system disables until manually re-enabled
7. **Given** PIR system is enabled, **When** button two is pressed, **Then** PIR system toggles between enabled and disabled states
8. **Given** system is connected to internet, **When** events occur, **Then** data is transmitted via MQTT and stored in database for monitoring

### Edge Cases
- What happens when temperature sensor fails during extreme weather?
- How does system handle conflicting commands (manual override vs automatic response)?
- What occurs when network connectivity is lost during emergency?
- How does system respond when RFID database is unavailable?
- What happens if multiple alarms trigger simultaneously?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST continuously display current temperature on OLED screen
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically open window when temperature exceeds predefined threshold and display cooling message
- **FR-003**: System MUST activate LED lighting and fan when motion sensor detects movement and display welcome message
- **FR-004**: System MUST trigger buzzer alarm and cycle RGB lights through all four colors when PIR motion sensor detects unauthorized movement
- **FR-005**: System MUST unlock door and display access granted status when authorized RFID card is detected
- **FR-006**: System MUST execute emergency protocol when gas is detected: open all doors and windows, activate fan, flash RGB warning lights, and sound buzzer alarm
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide manual gas alarm disable capability via button one
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow PIR security system to be toggled on/off via button two
- **FR-009**: System MUST establish and maintain WiFi connectivity for remote monitoring
- **FR-010**: System MUST transmit real-time data and alerts via MQTT protocol using HiveMQ broker
- **FR-011**: System MUST store RFID access records and sensor data in Supabase database for historical tracking and future expansion

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Environmental Data**: Temperature readings, gas detection status, motion events with timestamps and sensor locations
- **Access Records**: RFID card identifications, door entry logs, access granted/denied events with user identification
- **Security Events**: PIR motion alerts, unauthorized access attempts, system arm/disarm status changes
- **System States**: Current operational modes, manual overrides active, connectivity status, device health monitoring
- **Emergency Protocols**: Gas detection responses, evacuation procedures, automatic safety measure activation sequences
