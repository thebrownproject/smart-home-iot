> Distributed IoT system connecting ESP32 microcontroller with multiple sensors and web dashboard via RESTful API and MQTT

ðŸ”— **Live Demo:** *In development*

---

## Overview

A comprehensive IoT smart home automation system built for Cert IV capstone project, demonstrating distributed system architecture with ESP32 microcontroller, cloud messaging, and full-stack web development. The system monitors environmental conditions (temperature, humidity), manages security through RFID access control and motion detection, responds to emergencies (gas/steam detection), and provides real-time web monitoring with remote control capabilities. Extensive project planning preceded implementation, including PRD creation, system architecture design, MQTT topic structure definition, database schema modeling, and phased task breakdown.

## Architecture & Tech Decisions

Built using distributed IoT architecture with three-tier communication pattern: ESP32 publishes sensor data to HiveMQ MQTT broker, C# middleware subscribes to device messages for validation and database persistence, and Next.js web app subscribes for real-time updates while querying C# API for historical data. Chose MQTT-only communication for ESP32 to avoid memory leaks from MicroPython's urequests library, maintaining persistent connection with reconnect logic. Implemented C# middleware as single database gateway to centralize Supabase credentials and business logic, providing RESTful endpoints for queries while handling all database writes via MQTT subscriptions. RFID validation uses request/response pattern where ESP32 publishes card UID, C# queries authorized cards table, and publishes validation result back to device. Object-oriented MicroPython structure with handler classes for environmental monitoring, security, and outputs enables clean separation of concerns and testability. Event priority state machine ensures critical alerts (gas detection) override lower-priority events (motion detection).

## Project Planning

**Comprehensive planning documentation created before implementation:**

**Product Requirements Document (PRD):**
- Defined 9 user stories with detailed functional requirements
- Established tech stack for embedded, API, and web layers
- Documented code philosophy emphasizing robust embedded patterns
- Created success criteria aligned with assessment rubric

**System Architecture:**
- Designed full data flow diagram showing ESP32 â†’ MQTT â†’ C# â†’ Supabase â†’ Next.js
- Documented 5 message flow patterns (sensor persistence, real-time updates, historical queries, RFID validation, remote control)
- Specified MQTT topic structure with wildcard subscriptions for scalability
- Defined REST API endpoints for Sensors, RFID, Motion, Gas, and Status controllers

**Database Schema:**
- Modeled 7 PostgreSQL tables (sensor_logs, rfid_scans, motion_events, gas_alerts, device_status, authorized_cards, users)
- Designed relationships and constraints for data integrity
- Planned indexes for timestamp-based queries

**Task Breakdown:**
- Created phased development roadmap (Phase 1: Embedded, Phase 2: API, Phase 3: Web, Phase 4: Bonus)
- Defined granular tasks with dependencies and completion tracking
- Established milestones for each development phase

**File Structure:**
- Pre-planned directory organization for esp32/, api/, and web/ components
- Designed module separation for sensors, outputs, handlers, and communication layers

## Learnings & Challenges

**Key Learnings:**
- Architecting distributed IoT systems with MQTT publish/subscribe messaging patterns
- Object-oriented programming in MicroPython with handler classes for embedded system organization
- Designing RESTful API middleware with ASP.NET Core for IoT device communication
- Creating comprehensive project documentation (PRD, architecture diagrams, ERDs) before implementation
- Managing constrained hardware resources on ESP32 with non-blocking patterns and memory-conscious code

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Avoiding MicroPython urequests memory leaks by implementing MQTT-only communication strategy
- Designing secure RFID validation flow where ESP32 has no database credentials
- Implementing event priority state machine to handle competing sensor inputs
- Balancing real-time responsiveness with 30-minute database logging intervals
- Planning MQTT topic structure for single-device prototype with multi-device scalability
