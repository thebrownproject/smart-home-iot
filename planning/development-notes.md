# Development Notes

A running diary of development decisions, important context, and session-to-session notes.

---

## Session 1 - October 7, 2025 - Project Planning & Architecture ✅

**What was completed:**

- Created planning documents: `prd.md`, `tasks.md`, `architecture.md`, `database-schema.sql`
- Defined system architecture with corrected data flows
- Established 4-phase development approach
- Created `/continue` slash command for session resumption

**Important Decisions Made:**

1. **Architecture Pattern - 4-Layer System:**

   - **HOUSE Layer**: ESP32 with MicroPython (sensors/outputs)
   - **DATABASE Layer**: Supabase PostgreSQL (persistence)
   - **API Layer**: C# ASP.NET Core 9.0 (read endpoints, MVC pattern)
   - **WEB Layer**: Next.js dashboard (frontend, MQTT client)
   - **MQTT Broker**: HiveMQ Cloud (real-time message routing)

2. **Data Flow Patterns:**

   - **Persistence**: ESP32 → Supabase (direct HTTPS POST for data logging)
   - **Real-time updates**: ESP32 → HiveMQ MQTT → Next.js (sensor broadcasts)
   - **Historical queries**: Next.js → C# API → Supabase (GET endpoints)
   - **Control commands**: Next.js → HiveMQ MQTT → ESP32 (output control)
   - **Key decision**: ESP32 writes directly to Supabase (not through C# API)

3. **C# API Requirement:**

   - Initially thought it was bonus (Phase 4)
   - **Corrected**: Required from start per teacher specs
   - Phase 2: C# API Layer (separate from Phase 3 Web)
   - Purpose: Read-only query interface between web app and database
   - Pattern: MVC with Controllers, Models, Contracts + Dependency Injection

4. **ESP32 Communication:**

   - Uses both MQTT (real-time) and HTTPS (persistence)
   - **MQTT Publishes**: Sensor data to `home/*` topics (temperature, humidity, motion, gas, etc.)
   - **MQTT Subscribes**: Control commands from `home/control/*` topics (door, window, fan)
   - **HTTPS POST**: Direct writes to Supabase tables (sensor_logs, rfid_scans, etc.)
   - Rationale: ESP32 owns its data, simpler than middleware

5. **File Organization:**

   - All planning docs in `planning/` folder
   - Database schema extracted to `database-schema.sql`
   - Architecture diagrams in dedicated `architecture.md`
   - PRD kept lean (~4 pages) with references to other docs

6. **Development Phases:**
   - Phase 1: ESP32 embedded system (sensors, MQTT, direct DB writes)
   - Phase 2: C# API (read endpoints, MVC pattern, Supabase client)
   - Phase 3: Next.js dashboard (frontend, MQTT client, API calls)
   - Phase 4: Bonus features (auth, user roles, PIR arm/disarm)

**Current Status:**

- Phase: Planning complete
- Next Task: T1.2 - Create Supabase project and database schema
- Hardware: Some sensor testing already done

**Git Status:**

- Branch: `planning` (documentation branch)
- Planning docs created and organized

**Next Steps:**

1. Set up Supabase project with schema from `database-schema.sql`
2. Create `embedded/config.py` with WiFi, MQTT, and Supabase credentials
3. Begin sensor module implementations (DHT11, PIR)

## Session 2 - October 7, 2025 - GitHub Project Setup & Planning Document Alignment ✅

**What was completed:**

- Created GitHub Project board: "smart-home-project"
- Created 9 GitHub issues (US1-US9) with task checkboxes for all functional requirements
- All issues added to project backlog column
- Reviewed and aligned planning documents (PRD, tasks.md, architecture.md)
- Fixed alignment issues in tasks.md

**Important Decisions Made:**

1. **Issue Granularity:**

   - Each User Story = 1 GitHub Issue (9 total)
   - Functional Requirements = Checkboxes within issue body
   - Rationale: Provides progress tracking without board clutter (GitHub shows checkbox completion %)
   - Alternative considered: Each FR as separate issue (rejected - too granular for solo project)

2. **Branching Strategy (Updated October 8, 2025):**

   - `main` - Clean baseline, all planning and cleanup merged
   - `phase-1-embedded-core` - ESP32 implementation (current development)
   - `phase-2-api-layer` - C# API (future)
   - `phase-3-web-dashboard` - Next.js frontend (future)
   - Rationale: Phase-based branches align with development milestones and tech stacks
   - Legacy branches (`planning`, `001-comprehensive-smart-home`) merged and can be deleted

3. **Issue Closure Workflow:**

   - Use commit message keywords: `Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, `Resolves #N`
   - Issues auto-close when commits merge to `main` branch
   - Move issues across project board manually during development (Backlog → In Progress → Done)
   - Reference issues in commits: `Implements #N` for work-in-progress

4. **Document Alignment Fixes:**
   - Updated tasks.md: ASP.NET Core 8 → 9.0 (matches PRD requirement)
   - Updated tasks.md: Npgsql → Supabase NuGet package (matches architecture pattern)
   - Fixed Phase 4 milestone numbering: 3.3, 3.4 → 4.2, 4.3 (consistency)
   - Fixed Phase 4 task numbering: T3.5-T3.10 → T4.2-T4.7 (no conflicts)

**GitHub Issues Created:**

- Issue #2: US1 - Time-Based Lighting (3 FRs, Phase 1, HOUSE)
- Issue #3: US2 - Motion Detection & Response (3 FRs, Phase 1, HOUSE + DATABASE)
- Issue #4: US3 - Steam Detection & Window Control (3 FRs, Phase 1, HOUSE)
- Issue #5: US4 - Gas Detection & Emergency Response (4 FRs, Phase 1, HOUSE + DATABASE)
- Issue #6: US5 - RFID Access Control (5 FRs, Phase 1, HOUSE + DATABASE)
- Issue #7: US6 - Environmental Monitoring (4 FRs, Phase 1, HOUSE + WEB + DATABASE)
- Issue #8: US7 - Asthma Alert System (3 FRs, Phase 1, HOUSE + WEB)
- Issue #9: US8 - Real-Time System Monitoring (5 FRs, Phase 3, WEB)
- Issue #10: US9 - Remote Control (4 FRs, Phase 3, WEB + HOUSE)

**Current Status:**

- Phase: Planning complete, ready for Phase 1 implementation
- GitHub Project: Set up with 9 issues in Backlog
- Documentation: All planning docs aligned and consistent
- Next Task: T1.2 - Create Supabase project and database schema

**Git Status:**

- Branch: `planning` (current session)
- Planning docs updated and aligned
- Ready to switch to `001-comprehensive-smart-home` for implementation

**Next Steps:**

1. Switch to `001-comprehensive-smart-home` branch
2. Create Supabase project with schema from `database-schema.sql`
3. Set up MQTT credentials (HiveMQ Cloud)
4. Create `embedded/config.py` with WiFi, MQTT, and Supabase credentials
5. Begin sensor module implementations (T1.5-T1.9)
6. Move GitHub issue #7 (US6: Environmental Monitoring) to "In Progress" when starting DHT11 work

---

## Session 3 - October 8, 2025 - Repository Cleanup & Phase 1 Preparation ✅

**What was completed:**

- Reorganized repository structure to match architecture.md
- Created ESP32 deployment workflow with `/deploy` slash command
- Updated branch strategy to phase-based development

**Important Decisions Made:**

1. **Repository Structure Cleanup:**

   - Moved `src/` → `embedded/` to match file-structure.md
   - Moved `tests/hardware/` → `embedded/tests/` (layer-based testing)
   - Organized `Docs/` into subdirectories: reference-code/, libraries/, manuals/, tools/
   - Removed obsolete directories: `.specify/`, `specs/001-comprehensive-smart-home/`
   - Rationale: Clean structure before starting Phase 1, matches planned architecture

2. **Dependencies & Requirements:**

   - Updated `requirements.txt` to reflect actual desktop Python tools
   - `mpremote==1.26.1`, `pyserial==3.5`, `platformdirs==4.4.0`
   - Clarified: Desktop Python (venv) vs MicroPython (ESP32 libraries in Docs/)

3. **ESP32 Deployment Workflow:**

   - Created `deploy.py` script at root level
   - Uses `mpremote` to upload `embedded/*` to ESP32
   - Added `/deploy` slash command for easy deployment from Claude
   - Device target: `/dev/tty.usbserial-10`

4. **Branch Strategy Update:**
   - **New approach**: Phase-based branches (`phase-1-embedded-core`, etc.)
   - **Old approach**: Single implementation branch (`001-comprehensive-smart-home`)
   - Rationale: Clear separation between phases, aligns with project milestones
   - Merged legacy branches to `main` for clean baseline

**Documentation Updates:**

- `file-structure.md`: Added `embedded/tests/`, `Docs/` structure, deployment workflow
- `requirements.txt`: Accurate desktop Python dependencies
- `CLAUDE.md`: Updated branch strategy
- `development-notes.md`: Documented new branching approach

**Git Operations:**

- Committed: "Reorganize repository structure for Phase 1 development"
- Committed: "Add ESP32 deployment workflow"
- Pushed both commits to `main` branch
- **Current branch**: `main` (ready to create `phase-1-embedded-core`)

**Current Status:**

- Phase: Ready for Phase 1 implementation
- Next Task: T1.2 - Create Supabase project and database schema
- Repository: Clean, organized, documented

**Next Steps:**

1. Create `phase-1-embedded-core` branch from `main`
2. Run `/continue` to start Phase 1 workflow
3. Set up Supabase project with `database-schema.sql`
4. Create `embedded/config.py` with credentials
5. Begin sensor module implementations

---

## Session 4 - October 8, 2025 - Database Schema Design & Implementation ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.1 - Environment & Database Setup
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.2**: Create Supabase project and database schema
  - Created Supabase project "smart-home-project" (ID: uehfuypnccdqvdssknqq)
  - Designed improved relational schema with 6 foreign key relationships
  - Executed schema using Supabase MCP tools
  - Retrieved API credentials for ESP32 configuration

### Decisions Made

1. **Enhanced Relational Design for ERD:**
   - Added `devices` table to track ESP32 hardware (future-proof for multi-room expansion)
   - Created 4 foreign keys from event tables → devices (sensor_logs, motion_events, gas_alerts, rfid_scans)
   - Linked `rfid_scans` → `authorised_cards` → `users` (proper access control chain)
   - Total: 6 foreign key relationships vs original 1 (better for assessment ERD)

2. **Scope Refinement:**
   - Removed `location` and `status` from devices (single ESP32 in Phase 1, no value)
   - Removed `card_name` from authorised_cards (redundant with user.username)
   - Kept Phase 4 tables (`users`, `authorised_cards`) in schema but unused until Phase 4
   - Rationale: Better ERD now, no downside, easier Phase 4 implementation

3. **Australian Spelling:**
   - Changed `authorized_cards` → `authorised_cards` throughout codebase
   - Updated `authorized_card_id` → `authorised_card_id` foreign key column
   - Fixed in database-schema.sql, tasks.md, file-structure.md

4. **Database Normalization Patterns:**
   - Device info stored once, referenced by all event tables (3NF)
   - Used `ON DELETE CASCADE` for event logs (orphaned data cleanup)
   - Used `ON DELETE SET NULL` for optional relationships (user/card deletions don't break scan history)

### Schema Structure

**Tables (7 total):**
- `devices` - ESP32 hardware registry
- `sensor_logs` - Temperature, humidity, gas, steam readings
- `motion_events` - PIR detection timestamps
- `gas_alerts` - Emergency events with duration tracking
- `rfid_scans` - Access control scan history
- `users` - User accounts (Phase 4)
- `authorised_cards` - RFID card registry (Phase 4)

**Indexes (13 total):**
- Timestamp-based queries optimized for web dashboard
- Foreign key indexes for JOIN performance

### API Credentials Retrieved

```
SUPABASE_URL: https://uehfuypnccdqvdssknqq.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InVlaGZ1eXBuY2NkcXZkc3NrbnFxIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTk4ODMwNzksImV4cCI6MjA3NTQ1OTA3OX0.r4L-PRdbqae7nm23-H3FQQFNWnnh4kkA_HrlwGjnPE8
```

### Documentation Updated

- `planning/database-schema.sql` - Complete SQL with all 7 tables
- `planning/file-structure.md` - Added DeviceModel, UserModel, AuthorisedCardModel
- `planning/tasks.md` - Fixed spelling, marked T1.2 complete

### Next Session

- Continue with T1.3: Set up MQTT credentials in ESP32 config
- Will need: WiFi SSID/password, HiveMQ MQTT broker details
- Create `embedded/config.py` and `embedded/config.example.py`

---

## Session 5 - October 8, 2025 - MQTT Configuration & Testing ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.1 - Environment & Database Setup
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.3**: Set up MQTT credentials in ESP32 config
  - Created `embedded/config.example.py` template (gitignored credentials pattern)
  - Created `embedded/config.py` with actual WiFi, MQTT, and Supabase credentials
  - Added `config.py` to `.gitignore` for security
  - Created `embedded/tests/test_mqtt.py` for connection validation
  - Successfully tested MQTT pub/sub loop (WiFi + HiveMQ Cloud working)

### Decisions Made

1. **Config File Pattern (Security Best Practice):**
   - Use `config.py` instead of `.env` (MicroPython has no dotenv library)
   - Create `config.example.py` as template (committed to Git)
   - Actual `config.py` is gitignored (never committed)
   - Rationale: Same pattern as .env files in web development, demonstrates security awareness for portfolio

2. **YAGNI Principle Added to CLAUDE.md:**
   - Only implement features explicitly required by current task
   - Don't add "nice to have" features (debug flags, device IDs, intervals) until needed
   - Keep code simple and focused for student project
   - Rationale: Prevents feature bloat, easier to understand/maintain

3. **ESP32 Filesystem Cleanup:**
   - Removed old project files (`src/`, `boot.py`, `wifi_config.py`, test files)
   - Kept only `Lib/` directory (MQTT, DHT11, RFID, SSL libraries)
   - Deployed clean project structure from `embedded/` directory
   - Rationale: Clean environment = predictable behavior, no conflicts

4. **Deploy Script vs Slash Command:**
   - Deleted `deploy.py` Python script (unreliable `cp -r` with wildcards)
   - Updated `/deploy` slash command with manual file-by-file copying
   - Slash command includes venv activation (fixes mpremote not found error)
   - Complete sync of all `embedded/` directories (sensors, outputs, display, network, utils, tests)
   - Rationale: More reliable, visible, and flexible than automated script

5. **MQTT Test Strategy:**
   - Test publishes to `smarthome/test` topic, then subscribes to same topic
   - Receiving own published message confirms bidirectional communication works
   - Proves: WiFi ✓, MQTT broker ✓, SSL/TLS ✓, Publish ✓, Subscribe ✓
   - Foundation for FR6.3 (MQTT publishing), FR8.x (monitoring), FR9.x (control)

### Issues Encountered

1. **ESP32 Device Path Changes:**
   - Device path changed from `/dev/tty.usbserial-10` to `/dev/tty.usbserial-210` after reconnect
   - Solution: Updated deploy.py and slash command, added reminder to check `ls /dev/tty.usb*`

2. **mpremote Not Found:**
   - Initial deploy failed because mpremote wasn't in PATH
   - Solution: Activate venv before running commands (mpremote installed in venv)
   - Updated `/deploy` slash command to include venv activation

3. **Deploy Script Hanging:**
   - `mpremote cp -r embedded/* :` command hung/failed silently
   - Root cause: Wildcard path resolution unreliable with nested directories
   - Solution: Manual file-by-file copying (`cp embedded/boot.py :boot.py`, etc.)

### Test Results

**MQTT Connection Test (test_mqtt.py):**
```
✅ WiFi connected: 10.52.126.8
✅ MQTT client connected to HiveMQ Cloud (301d2478bf674954a8b8e5ad05732a73.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud:8883)
✅ Published: "Hello from ESP32 - MQTT test successful!"
✅ Received message back on smarthome/test topic
```

All credentials working:
- WiFi: CyFi / SecurityA40
- MQTT: HiveMQ broker with SSL/TLS (thebrownproject user)
- Supabase: https://uehfuypnccdqvdssknqq.supabase.co (anon key configured)

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `embedded/config.example.py` - Credential template
- `embedded/config.py` - Actual credentials (gitignored)
- `embedded/tests/test_mqtt.py` - MQTT connection test
- `.claude/commands/deploy.md` - Updated deployment process

**Modified:**
- `.gitignore` - Added `embedded/config.py`
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added YAGNI principle section
- `planning/tasks.md` - Marked T1.3 complete

**Deleted:**
- `deploy.py` - Replaced with slash command

### Next Session

- Continue with T1.4: Create project file structure
- Note: Most structure already exists (sensors/, outputs/, display/, network/, utils/, tests/)
- May just need to verify placeholder files and boot.py WiFi initialization
- Then move to Milestone 1.2: Sensor Module Implementation

---

## Session 5 (continued) - WiFi Boot Initialization

### Additional Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.4**: Create project file structure
  - Verified all directories exist (sensors/, outputs/, display/, network/, utils/, tests/)
  - Updated `embedded/boot.py` with WiFi initialization and timeout handling
  - Placeholder files already created from previous setup
  - `.gitignore` already includes `config.py`

### WiFi Boot Implementation

**Added to boot.py:**
```python
# WiFi initialization with 10-second timeout
wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)
wlan.connect(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASSWORD)

timeout = 10
while not wlan.isconnected() and timeout > 0:
    print(f"Waiting for WiFi connection... ({timeout}s left)")
    time.sleep(1)
    timeout -= 1
```

**Design decision - Graceful degradation:**
- WiFi failure prints warning but system continues to main.py
- Rationale: Better for development/debugging (can still access REPL)
- Network-dependent features will fail with clear error messages
- Alternative considered: `sys.exit(1)` or `machine.reset()` (rejected as too strict for dev)

### Milestone 1.1 Status

**Milestone 1.1: Environment & Database Setup** ✅ **COMPLETE**

All tasks finished:
- ✅ T1.1: Hardware validation testing
- ✅ T1.2: Supabase project and database schema
- ✅ T1.3: MQTT credentials in ESP32 config
- ✅ T1.4: Project file structure

### Next Session

- Begin **Milestone 1.2**: Sensor Module Implementation
- Start with T1.5: Implement DHT11 sensor class (temperature/humidity)
- Reference code: `Docs/reference-code/pj9_1_XHT11.py`

---

## Session 6 - October 8, 2025 - Sensor Module Implementation

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.2 - Sensor Module Implementation
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Started (In Progress)

- [~] **T1.6**: Implement PIR motion sensor class
  - Implementation complete with debounce logic (500ms)
  - Uses digital Pin 14, returns boolean
  - Needs hardware testing to verify motion detection

- [~] **T1.7**: Implement Gas sensor class
  - Implementation complete with active LOW logic
  - Uses Pin 23 with PULL_UP resistor
  - Returns True when gas detected (pin reads 0)
  - Needs hardware testing with gas sensor

- [~] **T1.8**: Implement Steam/Moisture sensor class
  - Implementation complete using ADC (analog sensor)
  - Uses Pin 34 with 12-bit ADC, 0-3.3V range
  - Threshold: 746 ADC value (equivalent to 0.6V from reference)
  - Needs hardware testing with moisture simulation

- [~] **T1.9**: Implement RFID reader class
  - Implementation complete with two-step scan process
  - Uses I2C (SCL:22, SDA:21, addr:0x28)
  - Returns card ID as concatenated string for uniqueness
  - Needs hardware testing with RFID cards

### Decisions Made

**DHT11 Sensor (reviewed existing code):**
- Kept error handling pattern (return None on OSError)
- No temperature validation (-20 to 60°C) - deemed scope creep, not in requirements
- Documented that `read_data()` is more efficient than calling `read_temperature()` and `read_humidity()` separately

**PIR Sensor:**
- Added debounce logic IN sensor class (500ms threshold)
- Alternative considered: debounce in main.py (rejected for encapsulation)
- Used `time.ticks_diff()` for proper timer wrap-around handling

**Gas Sensor:**
- Determined NO debounce needed (sustained event, not quick trigger)
- Active LOW logic: Pin reads 0 when gas detected (PULL_UP resistor)
- Fan control logic stays in main.py (separation of concerns)

**Steam Sensor:**
- Changed from digital to analog (ADC) based on reference code
- Pin 34 (ADC capable), not Pin 24
- Threshold 746 raw ADC = 0.6V (reference code pattern)
- Servo control stays in main.py

**RFID Sensor:**
- Two-method design: `scan_card()` reads card, `get_card_id()` extracts UID
- String concatenation for UID (e.g., "147210521") vs sum (safer, no collisions)
- Safety check in `get_card_id()`: verify `uid.size > 0` before extracting

### Key Learning Moments

**Analog vs Digital Sensors:**
- Digital (PIR, Gas): Returns 0 or 1, simple Pin.IN
- Analog (Steam): Returns 0-4095, needs ADC configuration
- Formula: `voltage = adc_value / 4095.0 * 3.3`

**Active HIGH vs Active LOW:**
- Steam sensor: Active HIGH (moisture = pin reads 1)
- Gas sensor: Active LOW with PULL_UP (gas = pin reads 0)

**Separation of Concerns:**
- Sensors read hardware, return data (pure functions)
- Main loop handles business logic (what to do with sensor data)
- Output control, MQTT publishing, database logging = main.py responsibility

### Next Session

- **Hardware testing required** for T1.6, T1.7, T1.8, T1.9
- Connect ESP32 and test each sensor individually
- Verify readings match expected behavior
- Only mark tasks complete after successful hardware validation
- Next: Continue Milestone 1.2 testing, or move to Milestone 1.3 (Outputs)

---
## Session 7 - October 9, 2025 - Sensor Testing & Validation ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core  
**Milestone**: 1.2 - Sensor Module Implementation  
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.6**: Implement PIR motion sensor class - Test created and hardware validated
- [x] **T1.7**: Implement Gas sensor class - Test created with validation logic
- [x] **T1.8**: Implement Steam/Moisture sensor class - Test created
- [x] **T1.9**: Implement RFID reader class - Fixed bugs, test created, hardware validated

### Decisions Made

1. **Test Organization Structure:**
   - Created `embedded/tests/sensors/` subdirectory for sensor-specific tests
   - Pattern: One test file per sensor matching production code
   - Follows existing infrastructure (matches `tests/test_mqtt.py` pattern)
   - Rationale: Clean separation of test vs production code, professional organization for portfolio

2. **Sensor Constructor Simplification:**
   - Removed pin number parameters from all sensor classes
   - Pin assignments now hardcoded in `__init__()` (matches hardware pinout document)
   - DHT11: Pin 17, PIR: Pin 14, Gas: Pin 23, Steam: Pin 34, RFID: I2C (21/22)
   - Rationale: Single ESP32 with fixed wiring, YAGNI principle (don't need pin flexibility)

3. **Testing Philosophy - Assert vs Simple Validation:**
   - Started with `assert` statements for type/range validation
   - User preferred simpler tests without assertions (personal choice)
   - Final approach: Show readings, count valid results, pass/fail based on test completion
   - Rationale: Tests prove sensor responds without crashing, easier to understand

4. **Human-in-the-Loop Test Design:**
   - DHT11: Automated (sensor always returns values)
   - RFID: Manual trigger required (user scans card during test, pass if ≥1 scan)
   - Gas/Steam: Optional manual trigger (tests pass on valid readings, bonus if triggered)
   - Rationale: Realistic testing for classroom environment without actual gas/steam

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **RFID Library Import Error:**
   - **Problem**: `ImportError: no module named 'mfrc522_i2c'`
   - **Root Cause**: Missing `soft_iic.py` dependency in ESP32 `Lib/` folder
   - **Solution**: Uploaded `soft_iic.py` from reference code to `Lib/` directory
   - **Learning**: MicroPython requires manual dependency management (no auto-install like pip)

2. **RFID I2C Communication Failure:**
   - **Problem**: "IIC slave device not ack" error
   - **Root Cause**: Pin objects passed to `mfrc522()` instead of integers
   - **Wrong**: `mfrc522(Pin(22), Pin(21), 0x28)`
   - **Correct**: `mfrc522(22, 21, 0x28)`
   - **Solution**: Fixed rfid.py to pass raw pin numbers (library creates Pin objects internally)
   - **Learning**: Always check reference code for exact API usage patterns

3. **I2C Device Detection Issues:**
   - **Problem**: Initially `I2C.scan()` returned empty list `[]`
   - **Possible causes**: USB-C power delivery issues, loose connections, faulty RFID module
   - **Solution**: Switched RFID module, re-seated connections
   - **Result**: Scan showed `['0x27', '0x28']` (OLED + RFID detected)
   - **Learning**: Hardware troubleshooting is iterative - power, wiring, then code

4. **Import Path Confusion:**
   - **Question**: Does `from sensors.dht11 import DHT11Sensor` work without modifying `__init__.py`?
   - **Answer**: Yes! `__init__.py` marks package, Python auto-discovers `.py` files
   - **Learning**: Direct module imports work by default, package-level imports need `__init__.py` configuration

### Test File Patterns Established

**DHT11 Test** (`test_dht11.py`):
- Tests `read_data()`, `read_temperature()`, `read_humidity()` methods
- 15 total readings (5 per method) with 2-second intervals
- Score: 15/15 = pass, validates sensor returns non-None values
- ~30 seconds runtime

**RFID Test** (`test_rfid.py`):
- Tests `scan_card()` and `get_card_id()` methods
- User prompt: "Scan card during test (5 attempts, 2s intervals)"
- Pass condition: ≥1 successful scan detected
- Displays card ID when detected

**Gas Test** (`test_gas.py`):
- Tests `read_value()` (returns 0 or 1) and `is_gas_detected()` (returns bool)
- 5 readings + 1 boolean check = 6 total tests
- Shows interpretation: "GAS DETECTED ⚠️" vs "No gas (normal)"
- Pass if all 6 tests complete without errors

**Steam Test** (created by user, similar pattern expected):
- Should test `read()` (ADC 0-4095) and `is_moisture_detected()` (bool)
- Optional user trigger instructions

### Files Created

**Test Files:**
- `embedded/tests/sensors/__init__.py` - Package marker
- `embedded/tests/sensors/test_dht11.py` - DHT11 automated test (41 lines)
- `embedded/tests/sensors/test_rfid.py` - RFID manual test (32 lines)
- `embedded/tests/sensors/test_gas.py` - Gas sensor test (38 lines)
- `embedded/tests/I2Ctst.py` - I2C bus scanner (4 lines)

**Modified Sensor Classes:**
- `embedded/sensors/dht11.py` - Removed `pin_number` parameter
- `embedded/sensors/pir.py` - Removed `pin` parameter  
- `embedded/sensors/gas.py` - Removed `pin` parameter
- `embedded/sensors/steam.py` - Removed `pin` parameter
- `embedded/sensors/rfid.py` - Fixed to pass integers, not Pin objects

### Key Learning Moments

**MicroPython Import System:**
- `__init__.py` marks directories as packages
- Direct imports (`from sensors.dht11 import X`) work automatically
- Package-level imports (`from sensors import X`) require `__init__.py` configuration
- No automatic dependency resolution - libraries must be manually uploaded

**I2C Debugging Workflow:**
1. Check power (voltage stable? sufficient current?)
2. Scan bus (`I2C.scan()`) to verify device responds
3. Check library API (reference code shows correct usage)
4. Test initialization (does class instantiate without errors?)
5. Test functionality (can read data?)

**Testing in Embedded Systems:**
- Can't mock hardware - tests verify real sensor integration
- Pass criteria: "Does sensor work?" not "Can we trigger it?"
- Manual triggers acceptable for classroom constraints
- Simple tests > complex assertions for student projects

### Milestone 1.2 Status

**Milestone 1.2: Sensor Module Implementation** ✅ **COMPLETE**

- Start with T1.11: Implement RGB LED (SK6812) class
- Note: T1.10 (basic LED) already complete from previous work
- Next tasks: RGB LED, Servo, Fan, Buzzer
- Will need reference code from `Docs/reference-code/` for each output

---
## Session 8 - October 9, 2025 - Output Module Implementation ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core  
**Milestone**: 1.3 - Output Module Implementation  
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.10**: Implement LED control class - Fixed from previous session, added test
- [x] **T1.11**: Implement RGB LED (SK6812) class - NeoPixel control with color methods
- [x] **T1.12**: Implement Servo motor class - Generic class for door/window servos
- [x] **T1.13**: Implement Fan control class - H-bridge motor control with PWM
- [x] **T1.14**: Implement Buzzer class - PWM-based beep patterns with volume control

### Decisions Made

1. **RGB LED Implementation:**
   - Used `neopixel.NeoPixel.fill()` for efficient multi-LED control (all 4 LEDs same color)
   - Tuple unpacking (`*color`) in `flash()` method to match `set_color(r, g, b)` signature
   - Hardcoded pin 26 and 4 LEDs (from reference docs)
   - Rationale: Matches requirements (solid colors + flashing), simple API

2. **Servo Motor Simplification (YAGNI Applied):**
   - Removed `set_angle(degrees)` method - not required by any FR
   - Kept only `open()` and `close()` methods (0° and 180°)
   - Generic class accepts pin parameter (door: pin 13, window: pin 5)
   - Duty cycle mapping: 0° = 25, 180° = 128 (from Keyestudio docs)
   - Rationale: All requirements only use fully open or fully closed positions

3. **Fan Motor Control:**
   - H-bridge driver with two PWM pins (INA: 19, INB: 18)
   - Only one direction needed (fans don't reverse)
   - `duty(700)` = ~68% power (good balance of speed and noise)
   - `is_running()` checks both pins for non-zero duty
   - Rationale: Simple on/off control matches FR4.2 requirement

4. **Buzzer Volume and Frequency:**
   - Initial frequency `100Hz` caused weird noises (too low, bass rumble)
   - **Fixed**: Set frequency to `2000Hz` in `__init__()` (clear beep tone)
   - Initial `duty(512)` too loud → reduced to `duty(100)` (~10% volume)
   - Added `duration` parameter to `beep()` for flexible beep lengths
   - Rationale: User comfort + classroom environment (can't be too loud!)

5. **Utility Script Organization:**
   - Created `embedded/utils/init_window_servo.py` for one-time servo calibration
   - Copied from Keyestudio docs (moves servo through 0° → 90° → 0°)
   - Purpose: Set servo to known position before installing servo arm
   - Rationale: Utils folder for setup scripts that aren't part of main application

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **RGB LED Flash Method - Tuple Unpacking:**
   - **Problem**: `flash(color, times)` called `set_color(color)` but `set_color` expects `(r, g, b)` not tuple
   - **Error**: `TypeError: function takes 4 positional arguments but 2 were given`
   - **Solution**: Use unpacking operator: `self.set_color(*color)`
   - **Learning**: `*` unpacks tuple `(255, 0, 0)` into separate args `255, 0, 0`

2. **Servo set_angle() Removed:**
   - **Question**: Task spec said `set_angle(degrees)` but requirements only need open/close
   - **Decision**: Removed method (YAGNI principle)
   - **Updated**: tasks.md line 118 to remove `set_angle()` from method list
   - **Rationale**: No FR uses intermediate angles (45°, 90°, etc.)

3. **Buzzer Frequency Issues:**
   - **Problem**: First beep normal, subsequent beeps had "weird noises"
   - **Root Cause**: `beep()` called `freq(100)` every time, re-setting frequency
   - **Solution**: Move `freq(2000)` to `__init__()`, only set duty in `beep()`
   - **Also fixed**: Changed 100Hz → 2000Hz for clearer tone
   - **Learning**: PWM frequency = pitch (set once), duty cycle = volume (change dynamically)

4. **Buzzer Too Loud:**
   - **Problem**: `duty(512)` (50%) extremely loud in classroom
   - **Solution**: Reduced to `duty(100)` (~10% volume)
   - **User note**: "Working much better, however... way too loud"
   - **Adjustable**: Can tune further to `duty(50)` if still too loud

### Test Files Created

**Outputs:**
- `embedded/tests/outputs/test_led.py` - Basic LED on/off/toggle test
- `embedded/tests/outputs/test_rgb.py` - RGB solid colors + flashing patterns
- `embedded/tests/outputs/test_fan.py` - Fan on/off with `is_running()` verification  
- `embedded/tests/outputs/test_buzzer.py` - Beep patterns with various durations

**All tests passed on hardware** - outputs respond correctly!

### Key Learning Moments

**PWM Control Patterns:**
- **Servo**: Frequency 50Hz (standard), duty cycle controls angle (25-128)
- **Fan**: Frequency 10kHz, duty cycle controls speed (0-1023, use ~700)
- **Buzzer**: Frequency controls pitch (2kHz = clear beep), duty controls volume (100 = quiet)
- **RGB LED**: Uses NeoPixel protocol (not PWM), `fill()` sets all LEDs at once

**YAGNI in Practice:**
- Servo `set_angle()` removed - no requirement needs it
- Fan only spins one direction - no reverse needed
- Buzzer no custom frequencies - 2kHz works for all beeps
- Simpler code = fewer bugs = easier maintenance

**Hardware Testing Philosophy:**
- Volume/speed settings need human judgment (too loud? too fast?)
- Can't programmatically verify "correct" buzzer volume
- Tests validate hardware responds + code doesn't crash
- User confirms: "passes" = works acceptably in real environment

### Milestone 1.3 Status

**Milestone 1.3: Output Module Implementation** ✅ **COMPLETE**

All tasks finished:
- ✅ T1.10: LED control class
- ✅ T1.11: RGB LED (SK6812) class
- ✅ T1.12: Servo motor class
- ✅ T1.13: Fan control class  
- ✅ T1.14: Buzzer class

All outputs tested and hardware-validated!

### Next Session

- Begin **Milestone 1.4**: Display & Network Integration
- T1.15: Implement OLED display class (SSD1306, I2C)
- T1.16: WiFi connection manager (with retry logic)
- T1.17: MQTT client wrapper (pub/sub methods)
- T1.18: Supabase HTTP client (database logging)

---

## Session 9 - October 9, 2025 - Display Module Implementation (LCD1602) ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core  
**Milestone**: 1.4 - Display & Network Integration  
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.15**: Implement OLED display class - Actually 16x2 character LCD, not OLED

### Decisions Made

1. **Hardware Clarification - LCD vs OLED:**
   - Documentation said "OLED SSD1306" but actual hardware is 16x2 character LCD (LCD1602)
   - Evidence: I2C scan shows address 0x27 (typical for LCD), not 0x3C (typical for OLED SSD1306)
   - Session 7 notes said "OLED + RFID" but meant LCD (0x27) + RFID (0x28)
   - Decision: Use `i2c_lcd` library from reference code, not `ssd1306`

2. **Library Location - /Lib/ vs embedded/display/:**
   - Initial approach: Copied `i2c_lcd.py` and `lcd_api.py` to `embedded/display/`
   - **Better approach**: Upload to ESP32 `/Lib/` folder (like other dependencies)
   - Rationale: Keeps app code separate from library dependencies, matches existing pattern (mfrc522, soft_iic)
   - Import changes from `from display.i2c_lcd import I2cLcd` → `from i2c_lcd import I2cLcd`

3. **Class Name "OLED" Despite LCD Hardware:**
   - Kept class name as `OLED` for API compatibility with requirements
   - Added docstring note explaining discrepancy
   - Methods match required API: `show_text()`, `clear()`, `show_temp_humidity()`

4. **Default Parameters for Flexibility:**
   - `show_text(line1, line2="")` - Makes second line optional
   - Allows single-line displays: `oled.show_text("Status: OK")`
   - Or two-line: `oled.show_text("Hello", "World")`

5. **String Truncation for Safety:**
   - LCD is 16 chars wide, added `[:16]` slicing to prevent overflow
   - Prevents runtime errors if strings exceed display width

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **ImportError: no module named 'ssd1306':**
   - **Problem**: Initial implementation tried to use SSD1306 OLED library
   - **Root Cause**: Hardware is actually a character LCD, not OLED
   - **Solution**: Switched to `i2c_lcd` library from reference code (pj8_1_lcd1602)
   - **Learning**: Always verify actual hardware with I2C scan before assuming specs

2. **File Organization Confusion:**
   - **Question**: Where should LCD libraries go - app code or Lib folder?
   - **Answer**: `/Lib/` folder on ESP32 for reusable dependencies
   - **Pattern**: App code in `embedded/`, libraries in `/Lib/`

3. **ImportError: no module named 'i2c_lcd' (initially):**
   - **Problem**: Tried importing from `display.i2c_lcd` when files weren't deployed
   - **Solution**: User uploaded `i2c_lcd.py` and `lcd_api.py` to ESP32 `/Lib/`
   - **Result**: Simple import `from i2c_lcd import I2cLcd` works

### Implementation Details

**OLED Class (embedded/display/oled.py):**
- Uses `I2cLcd` from `i2c_lcd` library (16x2 LCD1602)
- I2C address: 0x27 (not 0x3C)
- Methods:
  - `show_text(line1, line2="")` - Display 1 or 2 lines with auto-truncation
  - `clear()` - Clear display
  - `show_temp_humidity(temp, humidity)` - Format and display sensor data

**Test File (embedded/tests/display/test_oled.py):**
- Tests all three methods with delays
- Displays "Hello" / "World", then "Temp: 20C" / "Humid: 50%", then clears
- User confirmed working on hardware

### Key Learning Moments

**Character LCD vs OLED Display API:**
- **LCD (HD44780)**: `clear()`, `move_to(x, row)`, `putstr(text)` - Row/column based
- **OLED (SSD1306)**: `fill()`, `text(str, x, y)`, `show()` - Pixel-based with frame buffer
- LCD is simpler for text-only displays, OLED allows graphics/custom fonts

**I2C Address as Hardware Identifier:**
- 0x27 = Character LCD with PCF8574 I2C backpack
- 0x3C = OLED SSD1306 display
- 0x28 = RFID RC522 reader (in this project)
- Always run I2C scan to verify actual hardware!

**MicroPython Library Management:**
- No package manager like pip - manual file uploads required
- `/Lib/` folder = global library location (like site-packages)
- Libraries with dependencies need ALL files uploaded (e.g., i2c_lcd.py + lcd_api.py)

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `embedded/display/oled.py` - LCD display class (26 lines)
- `embedded/display/__init__.py` - Package marker
- `embedded/tests/display/test_oled.py` - Display test with delays
- `embedded/tests/display/__init__.py` - Package marker

**Uploaded to ESP32 /Lib/:**
- `i2c_lcd.py` - LCD I2C driver (from pj8_1_lcd1602)
- `lcd_api.py` - HD44780 LCD API (dependency)

**Modified:**
- `planning/tasks.md` - Marked T1.15 complete, clarified LCD vs OLED

### Test Results

**Display Test (test_oled.py):**
```
✓ OLED initialized
✓ Test 1: Displaying 'Hello' / 'World' (3 seconds)
✓ Test 2: Displaying temp/humidity (3 seconds)  
✓ Test 3: Clearing display
✓ OLED test completed successfully!
```

All methods working correctly on 16x2 LCD hardware.

### Next Session

- Continue with **T1.16**: Implement WiFi connection manager
- File: `embedded/network/wifi_manager.py`
- Methods: `connect()`, `is_connected()`, `get_ip()`
- Features: Auto-connect on boot, retry logic with exponential backoff

---

## Session 10 - October 10, 2025 - WiFi Manager Implementation ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core  
**Milestone**: 1.4 - Display & Network Integration  
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.16**: Implement WiFi connection manager
  - Created WiFiManager class with retry logic (5 attempts, 2-second intervals)
  - WiFi interface reset on each connection to clear error states
  - Integrated into main.py with LCD status display
  - Displays network name (SSID) instead of IP for better UX

### Decisions Made

1. **Folder Naming Refactor:**
   - Renamed `embedded/` → `esp32/` (hardware-specific naming)
   - Renamed `network/` → `comms/` (avoids conflict with Python built-in `network` module)
   - Rationale: `network` is a MicroPython built-in, causing import collision
   - New structure: `esp32/comms/wifi_manager.py`

2. **Simplified Retry Logic (Not Exponential Backoff):**
   - Student opted for simple fixed 2-second intervals instead of exponential backoff
   - 5 total attempts = 10 seconds max wait time
   - Reasoning: YAGNI principle - single device, stable environment, easier to understand
   - Exponential backoff is overkill for this use case

3. **WiFi Interface Reset Pattern:**
   - Added `disconnect()` + `active(False)` + `active(True)` before each connection
   - Clears "WiFi Internal Error" state from previous failed attempts
   - Critical for reusability - can call `connect()` multiple times

4. **boot.py WiFi Removal:**
   - Removed WiFi connection logic from boot.py (caused conflicts)
   - WiFiManager now has full control from main.py
   - boot.py only handles minimal system initialization (gc.collect, memory info)

5. **User-Focused Display:**
   - LCD shows network name (SSID) not IP address
   - User confirmed: "Connected to CyFi" more useful than "Connected to 10.52.126.8"
   - IP still printed to serial for debugging

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **ImportError: no module named 'network.wifi_manager':**
   - **Problem**: `network` is a built-in MicroPython module
   - **Root Cause**: Python prioritizes built-ins over user folders
   - **Solution**: Renamed folder `network/` → `connectivity/` → `comms/`
   - **Learning**: Always check for built-in module name conflicts

2. **OSError: Wifi Internal Error:**
   - **Problem**: Calling `wlan.connect()` when already connected or in error state
   - **First attempt**: Added check for `isconnected()` before connecting
   - **Second issue**: Failed connection left interface in bad state
   - **Final solution**: Reset WiFi interface (disconnect + deactivate + activate) before every connection
   - **Pattern**: `wlan.disconnect()` → `wlan.active(False)` → `time.sleep(0.5)` → `wlan.active(True)`

3. **boot.py vs main.py Conflict:**
   - **Problem**: boot.py connected to WiFi, then WiFiManager tried to connect again → "Internal Error"
   - **Solution**: Removed all WiFi logic from boot.py
   - **Decision**: boot.py = system init only, main.py = application init (including WiFi)

4. **Serial Output Not Visible:**
   - **Problem**: User couldn't see print statements from boot.py/main.py
   - **Root Cause**: No serial monitor connected
   - **Solution**: User connected via VS Code MicroPico REPL
   - **Learning**: Always connect serial monitor when debugging ESP32 boot sequence

### Implementation Details

**WiFiManager Class (esp32/comms/wifi_manager.py):**
- `__init__()`: Create WLAN interface, set max_retries = 5
- `connect()`: Reset interface, connect with retry loop (2s intervals), return True/False
- `is_connected()`: Returns `wlan.isconnected()` directly (no state caching)
- `get_ip()`: Returns IP if connected, None otherwise

**main.py Integration:**
- Shows welcome message on LCD
- Calls `wifi_manager.connect()`
- Displays "WiFi Connected / [SSID]" on LCD
- Enters "Test Mode" (placeholder for future event loop)

**Test File (esp32/tests/network/test_wifi.py):**
- Creates WiFiManager instance
- Calls `connect()` method
- Prints connection status and IP

### Key Learning Moments

**Built-in Module Name Collisions:**
- MicroPython has built-in modules: `network`, `time`, `machine`, `gc`, etc.
- User folders with same names cause import priority issues
- Solution: Use different names (`comms`, `utils`, `helpers`)

**WiFi Error Recovery Pattern:**
- WiFi interfaces can get stuck in error states
- Always reset interface before reconnecting: `disconnect()` → `deactivate()` → `activate()`
- Common in production IoT systems (reset modem before retry)

**UX Design in Embedded Systems:**
- Technical info (IP) vs user-relevant info (network name)
- Display what users recognize and care about
- Keep technical details in logs/serial for developers

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `esp32/comms/wifi_manager.py` - WiFiManager class (45 lines)
- `esp32/comms/__init__.py` - Package marker
- `esp32/tests/network/test_wifi.py` - WiFi connection test

**Modified:**
- `esp32/main.py` - Added WiFi connection with LCD status display
- `esp32/boot.py` - Removed WiFi connection logic (now minimal system init)
- `planning/tasks.md` - Marked T1.16 complete

**Renamed:**
- `embedded/` → `esp32/` (project-wide folder rename)
- `embedded/network/` → `esp32/comms/` (avoid built-in module collision)

### Test Results

**WiFi Connection Test:**
```
WiFi Manager Test
Connecting to WiFi: CyFi
WiFi connected successfully!
IP address: 10.52.126.8
✓ Test PASSED
```

**Main.py Boot Sequence (LCD Display):**
1. "Welcome to / Smart Home!" (2 seconds)
2. "Connecting to / WiFi..." (during connection)
3. "WiFi Connected / CyFi" (3 seconds)
4. "Test Mode / Ready" (stays on screen)

**Serial Output:**
```
Smart Home System - Boot Sequence Starting...
System Memory: XXXXX bytes free
Boot sequence complete - transferring to main.py
=== Smart Home System Starting ===
Connecting to WiFi...
WiFi connected to CyFi at ip: 10.52.126.8
=== System Ready ===
Main loop not implemented yet - entering Test Mode
```

### Next Session - IMPORTANT HANDOVER NOTES

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Documentation Update Required**

All planning documents still reference old folder names. Next session MUST update:

1. **`planning/file-structure.md`**:
   - Change ALL `embedded/` → `esp32/`
   - Change ALL `network/` → `comms/`
   - Update file paths throughout

2. **`planning/tasks.md`**:
   - Update T1.17 (MQTT): `embedded/network/mqtt_client.py` → `esp32/comms/mqtt_client.py`
   - Update T1.18 (Supabase): `embedded/network/supabase.py` → `esp32/comms/supabase.py`
   - Search for ANY remaining `embedded/` or `network/` references

3. **`planning/architecture.md`**:
   - Update any code examples showing imports
   - Update file paths in explanations

4. **`CLAUDE.md`**:
   - Update deployment instructions
   - Update file structure references
   - Update example imports

5. **`README.md`** (when created):
   - Use correct folder structure from start

**Search commands to find remaining references:**
```bash
grep -r "embedded/" planning/
grep -r "network/" planning/
```

**Next Technical Task:**
- Continue with **T1.17**: Implement MQTT client wrapper
- File: `esp32/comms/mqtt_client.py`
- Use `umqtt.simple` library
- Methods: `connect()`, `publish()`, `subscribe()`, `check_messages()`

---

## Session 11 - October 11, 2025 - MQTT Client Wrapper & Documentation Updates ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.4 - Display & Network Integration
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.17**: Implement MQTT client wrapper
  - Created `SmartHomeMQTTClient` class with full error handling
  - All methods return boolean status for graceful error handling
  - Comprehensive test with self-echo pattern (subscribe + publish + check_messages)
  - Successfully tested on hardware with HiveMQ Cloud broker

### Decisions Made

1. **Class Naming to Avoid Collision:**
   - Named class `SmartHomeMQTTClient` instead of `MQTTClient`
   - Rationale: `MQTTClient` already imported from `umqtt.simple` - would cause name collision

2. **Callback-First Subscribe Pattern:**
   - Must call `set_callback()` BEFORE `subscribe()`
   - Order matters: `self.client.set_callback(callback)` → `self.client.subscribe(topic)`

3. **Library Organization:**
   - Moved MicroPython libraries to `esp32/lib/` in repository
   - Updated `planning/file-structure.md` to document library structure

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **Name Collision**: `MQTTClient` import vs class name → Renamed to `SmartHomeMQTTClient`
2. **Subscribe Order**: Callback must be set before subscribe → Swapped order in method
3. **Unreachable Code**: Duplicate line after return → Deleted line 51

### Test Results

MQTT Client Wrapper Test: ✅ ALL PASSED
- Connected to HiveMQ Cloud
- Subscribed to `home/test`
- Published test message
- Received message via callback

### Next Session

- Continue with **T1.18**: Implement Supabase HTTP client
- File: `esp32/comms/supabase.py`
- Use `urequests` for HTTP POST to Supabase

---
## Session 12 - October 11, 2025 - Supabase HTTP Client (Partial)

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.4 - Display & Network Integration
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks In Progress

- [~] **T1.18**: Implement Supabase HTTP client
  - Created `insert_sensor_log()` method with proper REST API integration
  - Successfully tested sensor logging to database (temperature=25°C)
  - Learned about ESP32 urequests constraints (manual JSON encoding, UTF-8 bytes)
  - `insert_rfid_scan()` method still needs implementation

### Decisions Made

1. **Database Device Record:**
   - Inserted device record via Supabase MCP: `device_id=1`, `device_type='esp32_main'`, `device_name='Smart Home Lab'`
   - Rationale: Foreign key constraint requires device record before sensor logs can be inserted

2. **HTTP Client Implementation Pattern:**
   - Use `urequests.post()` with manual JSON encoding: `ujson.dumps(data).encode('utf-8')`
   - Required headers: `apikey`, `Authorization`, `Content-Type: application/json`
   - REST API endpoint: `/rest/v1/table_name` (not direct PostgreSQL connection)
   - Status code 201 = successful INSERT (not 200)

3. **Memory Safety for ESP32:**
   - Always call `response.close()` immediately after checking status
   - Boolean return pattern (`True/False`) matches MQTT client for consistency
   - Manual JSON string encoding required (MicroPython urequests doesn't auto-handle `json=` parameter reliably)

4. **UTF-8 Encoding Requirement:**
   - HTTP requires bytes, not strings: `.encode('utf-8')` converts JSON string to bytes
   - Kept explicit encoding for clarity and reliability across MicroPython builds

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **HTTP 400 "Empty or invalid json":**
   - **Problem**: Initial attempts with `json=` parameter and `data=ujson.dumps()` both failed
   - **Root Cause**: MicroPython urequests expects byte-encoded data, not plain strings
   - **Solution**: Use `.encode('utf-8')` to convert JSON string to bytes
   - **Learning**: ESP32 HTTP libraries behave differently than desktop Python requests

2. **HTTP 409 Foreign Key Violation:**
   - **Problem**: `device_id=1` didn't exist in devices table
   - **Root Cause**: Schema has foreign key constraint (sensor_logs → devices)
   - **Solution**: Inserted device record via Supabase MCP with proper device type and name
   - **Learning**: Always verify database constraints before testing inserts

3. **Garbled Degree Symbol (°C):**
   - **Problem**: Degree symbol displayed as "��C" in debug output
   - **Impact**: None - Supabase stored it correctly as "°C" in database
   - **Note**: MicroPython ujson encoding quirk, doesn't affect actual data

### Test Results

**Supabase Insert Test:**
```
Status Code: 201 (Success)
Result: True
Database entry: id=2, device_id=1, sensor_type="temperature", value=25.00, unit="°C"
```

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `esp32/comms/supabase.py` - Supabase HTTP client class (partial - only `insert_sensor_log()` complete)
- `esp32/tests/comms/test_supabase.py` - Basic test for sensor log insertion

**Modified:**
- `planning/tasks.md` - Marked T1.18 as in-progress with status note

**Database:**
- Inserted device record: id=1 ("Smart Home Lab")
- Verified sensor_logs table working with test insert

### Next Session

- **Complete T1.18**: Implement `insert_rfid_scan(card_id, result)` method
- Add `device_id` foreign key to RFID scan data
- Test RFID scan logging to database
- Consider adding other helper methods if needed (motion_events, gas_alerts)

---

## Session 13 - October 11, 2025 - Supabase HTTP Client Complete ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.4 - Display & Network Integration
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.18**: Implement Supabase HTTP client
  - Completed `insert_rfid_scan()` method with proper column naming
  - Fixed column name from `result` to `access_result` (matches schema VARCHAR(20))
  - Added `authorised_card_id` foreign key parameter with default None
  - Tested RFID scan logging to database successfully

### Decisions Made

1. **RFID Scan Method Design - Three Parameters:**
   - `insert_rfid_scan(card_id, result, authorised_card_id=None)`
   - `card_id`: Raw RFID card identifier string (e.g., "147210521")
   - `result`: Access outcome as string - `"granted"` or `"denied"` (VARCHAR, not boolean)
   - `authorised_card_id`: Optional FK to `authorised_cards` table (audit trail for valid cards)
   - Rationale: Supports both denied scans (FK=None) and authorized scans (FK=record ID)

2. **Column Naming Alignment:**
   - Database schema uses `access_result VARCHAR(20)` not `result BOOLEAN`
   - Allows extensibility: `"granted"`, `"denied"`, future states like `"expired"`, `"revoked"`
   - Method parameter name `result` maps to database column `access_result` in data dict

3. **Foreign Key for Audit Trail:**
   - `authorised_card_id` creates relational link: rfid_scans → authorised_cards → users
   - Nullable FK allows logging denied scans (unknown cards) without breaking constraints
   - When card is authorized, stores both raw card_id AND the authorised_cards.id reference
   - Enables queries like "Who accessed the door?" via JOIN relationships

4. **YAGNI Applied - Additional Methods Deferred:**
   - Discussed need for `check_card_authorized()` (GET request), `insert_motion_event()`, `insert_gas_alert()`
   - Decision: Add methods as-needed when tasks require them (T1.20, T1.22, T1.23)
   - Rationale: Reduces current complexity, saves ESP32 memory, methods added incrementally

5. **Consistent Implementation Pattern:**
   - `insert_rfid_scan()` exactly matches `insert_sensor_log()` structure
   - Same headers: `apikey`, `Authorization`, `Content-Type`
   - Same encoding: `ujson.dumps(data).encode('utf-8')`
   - Same response handling: Check 201 status, close immediately, return boolean
   - Same error handling: Try/except with print, return False on failure

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **Schema Column Name Mismatch:**
   - **Problem**: Initial implementation used `"result": result` in data dict
   - **Root Cause**: Database column is `access_result`, not `result`
   - **Solution**: Changed line 45 to `"access_result": result`
   - **Learning**: Always verify exact column names from schema before implementation

2. **RFID Workflow Clarification:**
   - **Question**: Is `insert_rfid_scan()` for authorization or logging?
   - **Answer**: It's for logging AFTER authorization check happens
   - **Full workflow**:
     1. Read card →
     2. Check authorization (future `check_card_authorized()` GET method) →
     3. Respond to user (door open or buzzer) →
     4. Log event with result (`insert_rfid_scan()` POST method)
   - **Learning**: Separate GET (query/validate) from POST (insert/log) operations in REST APIs

3. **Parameter vs Column Name Discussion:**
   - **Question**: Should method parameter be `result` or `access_result` to match schema?
   - **Decision**: Keep parameter as `result` (simpler), map to `access_result` in data dict
   - **Rationale**: Cleaner method signature, mapping happens in one place (line 45)

### Key Learning Moments

**REST API Design Patterns:**
- **GET requests**: Query data (e.g., check if card exists in authorised_cards table)
- **POST requests**: Create data (e.g., log scan event to rfid_scans table)
- RFID access control needs BOTH operations in sequence

**Database Schema Types:**
- VARCHAR allows flexible categorical values ("granted", "denied", "expired")
- BOOLEAN limits to true/false, less extensible for future states
- Trade-off: VARCHAR uses slightly more storage but provides better future-proofing

**Foreign Key Relationships:**
- Nullable FKs (`ON DELETE SET NULL`) preserve history when referenced records deleted
- Example: If authorised_card deleted, scan history remains with NULL FK (card no longer valid)
- Enables audit queries even after card/user removal from system

### Files Modified

**Modified:**
- `esp32/comms/supabase.py` - Fixed column name `result` → `access_result` (line 45)
- `planning/tasks.md` - Marked T1.18 complete with updated method signatures

### Test Results

**RFID Scan Insert Test:**
```
Status Code: 201 (Success)
Result: True
Database entry: device_id=1, card_id="test123", access_result="denied", authorised_card_id=NULL
```

---

## Session 14 - October 11, 2025 - Time-Based LED Control & Architecture Refactor ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.5 - Core Automation Logic (US1-US5)
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.19**: Implement time-based LED control (FR1.1, FR1.2, FR1.3 - HOUSE)
  - Created `esp32/utils/time_sync.py` with NTP synchronization
  - Implemented timezone conversion (UTC+10 AEDT)
  - Built `is_nighttime()` logic (8pm-7am detection)
  - Refactored ESP32 architecture to 3-layer pattern
  - Created `esp32/app.py` (SmartHomeApp with event loop)
  - Created `esp32/system_init.py` (hardware initialization & boot sequence)
  - Simplified `esp32/main.py` to minimal orchestrator (15 lines)
  - Deleted `esp32/boot.py` (no longer needed)
  - LED control working: on during nighttime, off during daytime

### Decisions Made

1. **3-Layer Architecture Pattern:**
   - `main.py` - Entry point (orchestration only, 15 lines)
   - `system_init.py` - Hardware abstraction layer (initializes all sensors/outputs, boot sequence with WiFi/time sync)
   - `app.py` - Application logic layer (SmartHomeApp class with event loop containing automation rules)
   - Rationale: Clean separation of concerns, maintainable as complexity grows, professional structure for portfolio

2. **NTP Time Synchronization:**
   - Created `TimeSync` class with timezone-aware methods
   - Timezone offset stored in `config.py` (TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS = 10 for AEDT)
   - `sync_time()` - Call once at boot to sync with NTP servers
   - `get_local_time()` - Returns timezone-adjusted time tuple
   - `is_nighttime()` - Boolean check for 8pm-7am range with wraparound logic
   - Rationale: ESP32 has no RTC battery, must sync time on each boot

3. **Nighttime Detection Logic:**
   - Wraparound time range: `hour >= 20 OR hour < 7`
   - Cannot use `AND` logic for ranges crossing midnight
   - Pattern appears in overnight shifts, time-based scheduling systems
   - Returns boolean for simple LED control: `if is_nighttime(): led.on() else: led.off()`

4. **Deleted boot.py:**
   - MicroPython runs boot.py (optional) then main.py
   - All initialization now in `system_init.py` called from `main.py`
   - No need for boot.py - simplified to 2-file boot pattern
   - Rationale: Reduces file count, clearer control flow

5. **Dependency Injection Pattern:**
   - `main.py` creates SystemInit, passes to SmartHomeApp
   - All hardware objects flow through system object
   - SmartHomeApp extracts references: `self.led = system.led`
   - Single source of truth for hardware objects
   - Rationale: Professional pattern, scales well, easy to test

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **Timezone Calculation Bug:**
   - **Problem**: `is_nighttime()` returned True at 3pm
   - **Root Cause**: Forgot to multiply hours by 3600 (seconds conversion)
   - **Wrong**: `self.timezone_offset = TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS` (stored 10)
   - **Correct**: `self.timezone_offset = TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS * 3600` (stored 36000)
   - **Learning**: Always convert time units explicitly - hours → seconds = × 3600

2. **Servo Constructor Missing Pin Parameter:**
   - **Problem**: `TypeError: function takes 2 positional arguments but 1 were given`
   - **Root Cause**: `Servo()` requires pin parameter, `system_init.py` called `Servo()` without pin
   - **Solution**: Changed to `self.door_servo = Servo(pin=13)` and `self.window_servo = Servo(pin=5)`
   - **Learning**: Python error "2 arguments" counts `self` as position 1

3. **Buzzer Auto-Starting on Init:**
   - **Problem**: Buzzer sounded on system boot
   - **Root Cause**: PWM initialized without explicitly setting duty to 0
   - **Solution**: Added `self.buzzer.duty(0)` to Buzzer `__init__()`
   - **Learning**: Always initialize outputs to known safe state (duty=0, value=0)

4. **LED Class Name Mismatch:**
   - **Problem**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'Led'`
   - **Root Cause**: Class is `LED` (all caps) but importing `Led` (mixed case)
   - **Solution**: Fixed import to `from outputs.led import LED`
   - **Learning**: Python imports are case-sensitive, class names must match exactly

### Documentation Updates

All documentation updated to reflect new architecture:

1. **`planning/file-structure.md`:**
   - Updated structure diagram: removed boot.py, added app.py and system_init.py
   - Updated Key Files descriptions with 3-layer architecture explanation

2. **`CLAUDE.md`:**
   - Added "System Architecture (3-Layer Boot Pattern)" section
   - Explained main → system_init → app flow with rationale

3. **`.claude/commands/deploy.md`:**
   - Updated core files list: removed boot.py, added app.py and system_init.py
   - Changed folder references: `embedded/` → `esp32/`, `network/` → `comms/`

4. **`.claude/commands/continue.md`:**
   - Updated Key Files list to reflect new architecture

5. **`planning/tasks.md`:**
   - Updated T1.4 description to reference new architecture files

### Key Learning Moments

**Wraparound Time Logic:**
- Time ranges crossing midnight require OR logic, not AND
- Example: 8pm-7am = `hour >= 20 OR hour < 7`
- Appears in overnight shifts, scheduling systems, automation rules

**Dependency Injection in Embedded Systems:**
- Create hardware objects once, pass container object to app
- App extracts references: `self.led = system.led`
- Benefits: Single initialization, easy testing, clear dependencies

**Architecture Scalability:**
- Simple monolithic code works for 1-2 features
- Professional 3-layer separation necessary for 5+ automation rules
- Invest in structure early - makes future tasks faster

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `esp32/app.py` - SmartHomeApp class with event loop (35 lines)
- `esp32/system_init.py` - SystemInit class with hardware init and boot sequence (80 lines)
- `esp32/utils/time_sync.py` - TimeSync class with NTP and timezone handling (28 lines)
- `esp32/tests/utils/test_time_sync.py` - Time sync test

**Modified:**
- `esp32/main.py` - Simplified to orchestrator (15 lines)
- `esp32/system_init.py` - Added all hardware initialization (sensors, outputs, comms)
- `esp32/outputs/buzzer.py` - Added `duty(0)` to `__init__()` for safe startup
- `config.py` - Added TIMEZONE_OFFSET_HOURS, NIGHT_START_HOUR, NIGHT_END_HOUR
- `planning/tasks.md` - Marked T1.19 complete
- `planning/file-structure.md` - Updated with new architecture
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added architecture documentation
- `.claude/commands/deploy.md` - Updated file paths
- `.claude/commands/continue.md` - Updated key files list

**Deleted:**
- `esp32/boot.py` - No longer needed with new architecture

### Test Results

**Time Sync Test:**
```
Time synchronized successfully
(2025, 10, 11, 16, 1, 9, 5, 284)
Is nighttime: False
```
✅ Timezone conversion working (UTC 6am → AEDT 4pm)
✅ Nighttime detection accurate (4pm = daytime)

**LED Control Test:**
```
App running...
Daytime - LED OFF
Good day / Light is off
```
✅ LED responds to time checks
✅ LCD shows status messages

### Milestone 1.5 Progress

- Add motion detection to app.py event loop
- On motion: Set RGB to orange, log to database, publish MQTT
- Will need to add database/MQTT methods as needed (YAGNI)

## Session 15 - October 12, 2025 - Ultra-Lazy Loading Memory Optimization & PIR Motion Detection ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.5 - Core Automation Logic (US1-US5)
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.20**: Implement PIR motion response (FR2.1, FR2.2, FR2.3 - HOUSE/DATABASE)
  - PIR sensor polls every 5 seconds in main loop
  - On motion: RGB sets to orange, publishes MQTT, logs to database
  - Successfully inserts motion events to Supabase `motion_events` table
  - Memory-optimized ultra-lazy loading pattern implemented throughout

### Major Decisions Made

1. **Ultra-Lazy Loading Architecture Pattern:**
   - **Problem**: ESP32 running out of memory (ENOMEM errors) during HTTP POST operations
   - **Root cause**: Loading all sensors/outputs at boot consumed 25KB, leaving only 70KB free (HTTP needs 25-30KB)
   - **Solution**: Load sensors/outputs inside methods only when needed, delete immediately after use
   - Pattern: `from module import Class` → `obj = Class()` → use → `del obj` → `self.memory.collect()`
   - Applied to: system_init.py (all boot methods) and app.py (all event handlers)

2. **SystemInit Refactor - Minimal Boot:**
   - Removed ALL imports from top of file except essentials (time, Memory, config)
   - `__init__()` creates ONLY Memory utility object (1 object vs previous 14)
   - Each init method imports what it needs: WiFi, OLED, TimeSync, MQTT
   - Objects deleted immediately after use with `del` and `memory.collect()`
   - Result: Boot memory improved from 72KB → 95KB free (+23KB / +32%)

3. **SmartHomeApp Refactor - Event-Scoped Objects:**
   - `__init__()` creates ONLY Memory reference and persistent MQTT client (can't delete MQTT - needs persistent connection)
   - Each event handler imports sensors/outputs locally
   - Time-based lighting: Imports TimeSync, LED, OLED → uses → deletes
   - Motion detection: Imports PIRSensor, RGB → uses → deletes, then lazy-loads Supabase for DB insert
   - Memory baseline stable at 89-91KB throughout operation

4. **MQTT Persistence Requirement:**
   - Initial attempt deleted MQTT client after each publish → error: "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'write'"
   - Learning: MQTT maintains TCP connection to broker, cannot be recreated each time
   - Solution: Create MQTT once in app.__init__(), keep persistent (~3-5KB cost worth it)
   - All other objects (sensors, outputs, Supabase) can be safely deleted

5. **Memory Utility Class Pattern:**
   - Created `esp32/utils/memory.py` for consistent garbage collection tracking
   - Methods: `collect(reason)` prints memory after GC, `mem_free()` prints current free memory
   - Used throughout codebase: `self.memory.collect("After X")` for visibility
   - Helps debug memory leaks and track memory lifecycle

### Memory Optimization Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Boot start** | 96KB | **107KB** | +11KB |
| **After init** | 72KB | **95KB** | **+23KB (+32%)** |
| **App baseline** | 70KB | **91KB** | +21KB |
| **During motion event** | 69KB (ENOMEM) | **86KB** | +17KB |
| **HTTP POST success** | ❌ Failed | ✅ **Working** | Fixed! |

**Memory stability:**
- Baseline: 89-91KB free (idle)
- Motion event: 86-88KB (peak HTTP usage 84KB)
- Recovery: Returns to 89-91KB after event (GC working correctly)

### Implementation Pattern Established

**For one-time/infrequent operations (< 1Hz):**
```python
def _method(self):
    from module import Class
    obj = Class()
    # ... use obj ...
    del obj
    self.memory.collect("After method")
```

**For frequent operations (> 1Hz):**
- Keep object loaded (e.g., MQTT client)
- Trade-off: Persistent memory cost vs performance

**Objects that MUST persist:**
- ❌ MQTT client (maintains TCP connection)
- ❌ Memory utility (used throughout)

**Objects that CAN be lazy-loaded:**
- ✅ All sensors (PIR, DHT11, Gas, Steam, RFID)
- ✅ All outputs (LED, RGB, Servo, Fan, Buzzer)
- ✅ OLED display
- ✅ Supabase client
- ✅ WiFi manager (only needed at boot)
- ✅ TimeSync (only needed periodically)

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **ENOMEM Error During HTTP POST:**
   - **Problem**: `[Errno 12] ENOMEM` when calling `supabase.insert_motion_event()`
   - **Root Cause**: Only 69KB free before HTTP, but `urequests` needs 25-30KB for headers + body + response buffer
   - **First attempt**: Lazy-loaded Supabase → helped slightly (72KB free)
   - **Second attempt**: Removed `.encode('utf-8')` redundancy (RFID project pattern) → saved 2KB
   - **Final solution**: Ultra-lazy loading ALL objects → 91KB free baseline → HTTP works!

2. **Learning from RFID Scanner Project:**
   - Reviewed working RFID project code at `/Users/fraserbrown/Documents/Programming/Kangan/Web_Dev/Repos/rfid-rabbit-shelter-tracking-system/RFID/handheld-rfid-scanner-firmware.py`
   - Key insight: That project imports WiFi inside `_connect_to_wifi()` method and deletes after use
   - Pattern: `wifi_manager = WiFiManager()` → use → `del wifi_manager` → `gc.collect()`
   - Also learned: Send JSON directly without `.encode('utf-8')` - urequests handles it

3. **MQTT Persistence Issue:**
   - **Problem**: Created new MQTT client in each motion event → `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'write'`
   - **Root Cause**: MQTT needs persistent TCP socket connection to broker
   - **Solution**: Create MQTT once in `app.__init__()`, store as `self.mqtt`, reuse for all publishes
   - **Memory cost**: 3-5KB permanent (acceptable for reliability)

4. **Memory Class Import in Supabase:**
   - **Problem**: `supabase.py` had `import gc` and used `gc.collect()`, inconsistent with project pattern
   - **Solution**: Added `from utils.memory import Memory` and `self.memory = Memory()` to Supabase class
   - **Benefit**: Consistent memory tracking throughout codebase with labeled collection points

### Key Learning Moments

**Memory Fragmentation in Embedded Systems:**
- It's not just about total free memory - need CONTIGUOUS blocks
- 70KB fragmented memory < 90KB contiguous for large allocations
- HTTP requests need 25-30KB contiguous block for buffers
- Solution: Aggressive GC before expensive operations creates large free blocks

**Import Timing Matters:**
- Imports at top of file: Module loaded permanently into RAM
- Imports inside function: Module still cached by Python, but object lifecycle controlled
- `del` + `gc.collect()` frees object memory, not module code (acceptable trade-off)

**GET vs POST Memory Footprint:**
- GET requests: Small query string, small JSON response (~10-15KB)
- POST requests: Large headers + JSON body + response buffer (~25-30KB)
- For RFID auth: Can use GET for real-time checks (smaller memory), batch POST logs later

**Which Objects Need Persistence:**
- Stateful objects (MQTT, WiFi) maintain connections → must persist
- Stateless objects (sensors, outputs) recreate instantly → can delete
- Rule: If it holds a network socket or file handle, keep it loaded

### Files Created/Modified

**Modified:**
- `esp32/system_init.py` - Ultra-lazy loading: only Memory in __init__, all else imported in methods
- `esp32/app.py` - Ultra-lazy loading: only Memory + MQTT in __init__, sensors/outputs imported in handlers
- `esp32/comms/supabase.py` - Added Memory class usage, removed `.encode('utf-8')` from POST data
- `esp32/utils/memory.py` - Created Memory utility class for consistent GC tracking

**Commits:**
- "Implement lazy-loading pattern for Supabase client to optimize memory"
- "Implement aggressive lazy-loading to solve ENOMEM memory issues"

### Test Results

**Motion Detection Test:**
```
=== Smart Home System Starting ===
[MEMORY] GC after Before system init: 107040 bytes free.
...
[MEMORY] GC after After system init: 95696 bytes free.
=== System Ready ===
[MEMORY] GC after After MQTT setup: 91248 bytes free.
App running...
[MEMORY] GC after Motion detected: 88816 bytes free.
Motion - MQTT OK
[MEMORY] GC after Before DB insert: 88832 bytes free.
[MEMORY] GC after Before insert_motion_event: 86704 bytes free.
[MEMORY] GC after After insert_motion_event: 84112 bytes free.
Motion - DB OK
[MEMORY] GC after After motion handling: 86336 bytes free.
[MEMORY] GC after After motion check: 86432 bytes free.
```

✅ **All systems working:**
- Time-based LED control: Loading/deleting TimeSync, LED, OLED each check
- Motion detection: Loading/deleting PIR, RGB each poll
- MQTT publishing: Using persistent MQTT client
- Database inserts: Lazy-loading Supabase, deleting after use
- Memory stable: 86-91KB throughout operation

### Architecture Impact

**Scalability for remaining tasks:**
- T1.21 (Steam): Will import Steam + WindowServo in handler
- T1.22 (Gas): Will import Gas + Fan in handler
- T1.23 (RFID): Will import RFID + Buzzer + DoorServo in handler (GET for auth check, batch POST for logs)
- T1.24 (DHT11): Will import DHT11 + OLED in handler

**Pattern is proven and repeatable** - each automation loads only what it needs, memory stays stable ~85-90KB.

### Next Session

- Mark T1.20 complete in tasks.md
- Continue with **T1.21**: Steam detection & window control
- Apply same ultra-lazy pattern: Import Steam + WindowServo inside handler
- Expected memory: Stable ~85-90KB

## Session 16 - October 12, 2025 - Architecture Refactor: Modular Handlers Pattern ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.5 - Core Automation Logic (US1-US5)
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **Architecture Refactor**: Extract automation logic into modular handler classes
  - Created handler classes: `LightingHandler`, `MotionHandler`
  - Refactored `app.py` to use handler pattern with dependency injection
  - Fixed missing imports and parameter passing
  - Added RGB orange color to motion detection (FR2.2)

### Decisions Made

1. **Handler Class Design Pattern (Evolved from Initial Plan):**
   - **Initial plan**: Standalone functions taking `system` and `mqtt` parameters
   - **Final implementation**: Handler classes with `__init__()` and method taking `mqtt` parameter
   - **Rationale**: Classes provide better encapsulation, can own Memory utility, easier to test
   - **Pattern**: `LightingHandler().handle_time_based_lighting()` - stateless processors

2. **Dependency Injection for MQTT:**
   - Handlers don't store MQTT client as instance variable
   - MQTT passed as method parameter: `handle_motion_detection(self, mqtt)`
   - App layer owns persistent connections, handlers own business logic
   - Keeps handlers focused and testable - receive what they need, use it, done

3. **Handler Structure:**
   ```python
   class MotionHandler:
       def __init__(self):
           self.memory = Memory()

       def handle_motion_detection(self, mqtt):
           from sensors.pir import PIRSensor
           # ... lazy load, use, delete pattern
   ```

4. **Ultra-Lazy Loading Preserved:**
   - Handlers continue Session 15's memory optimization pattern
   - Each handler imports sensors/outputs inside method
   - Objects deleted after use with garbage collection
   - Memory stays stable at 85-90KB

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **Missing Memory Import in motion.py:**
   - **Problem**: `NameError: name 'Memory' is not defined`
   - **Solution**: Added `from utils.memory import Memory` at top of file
   - **Learning**: Each handler needs its own Memory utility for garbage collection

2. **MQTT Reference Error:**
   - **Problem**: `handle_motion_detection()` referenced `self.mqtt` which doesn't exist
   - **Solution**: Changed method signature to accept `mqtt` parameter, updated app.py to pass `self.mqtt`
   - **Pattern**: Dependency injection keeps handlers stateless

3. **Missing RGB Color Change:**
   - **Problem**: Motion handler checked PIR but didn't set RGB to orange (FR2.2 requirement)
   - **Solution**: Added `rgb.set_color(255, 165, 0)` when motion detected
   - **Learning**: Review FRs carefully when refactoring - easy to miss requirements

### Key Learning Moments

**Handler Design Pattern:**
- Handlers are stateless processors - they don't store app-level resources
- Dependency injection passes needed resources as method parameters
- This keeps handlers focused and testable
- App layer owns persistent connections (MQTT), handlers own business logic

**Refactoring Checklist:**
- When extracting code to new files, check ALL dependencies (imports, parameters, references)
- Test immediately after refactor to catch issues early
- Small, incremental changes are safer than big rewrites

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `esp32/handlers/lighting.py` - LightingHandler class with ultra-lazy loading (24 lines)
- `esp32/handlers/motion.py` - MotionHandler class with MQTT and Supabase integration (42 lines)

**Modified:**
- `esp32/app.py` - Refactored to use handler classes, passes MQTT to handlers
- `esp32/handlers/motion.py` - Added Memory import, RGB color change, fixed MQTT parameter

### Next Session

- Continue with **T1.21**: Steam detection & window control
- Create `handlers/steam.py` following established pattern
- Implement: Poll steam sensor → close window servo → flash RGB blue → publish MQTT
- Expected memory: Stable ~85-90KB with lazy loading pattern

---


## Session 17 - October 12, 2025 - Steam Detection & Handler Refinements ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.5 - Core Automation Logic (US1-US5)
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.21**: Implement steam detection & window control (FR3.1, FR3.2, FR3.3 - HOUSE)
  - Created `SteamHandler` class following modular handlers pattern
  - Implemented: Poll steam sensor → close window servo → flash RGB blue 3 times → publish MQTT
  - Added counter-based timeout to motion handler (10 seconds)
  - Fixed duplicate print statement in time sync
  - Confirmed handler file naming convention (`*_handler.py`)

### Decisions Made

1. **Handler Naming Convention:**
   - All handler files use `*_handler.py` suffix (e.g., `steam_handler.py`, `motion_handler.py`)
   - Prevents naming collisions with sensor files (e.g., `sensors/steam.py` vs `handlers/steam_handler.py`)
   - Improves IDE search results and file clarity
   - Pattern: `handlers/lighting_handler.py`, `handlers/motion_handler.py`, `handlers/steam_handler.py`

2. **RGB Control Strategy - Temporary Solution:**
   - Steam: Flash blue 3 times using `rgb.flash((0, 0, 255), 3)` (temporary indicator per FR3.3)
   - Motion: Set solid orange, turns off after timeout (persistent indicator per FR2.2)
   - Handlers do NOT turn off RGB in else blocks - prevents conflicts
   - Future: T1.29 will implement state machine with priority (gas > steam > motion)

3. **Motion Timeout Implementation - Counter-Based:**
   - User preferred simple countdown over `time.time()` timestamps
   - Pattern: `motion_count = 3` decrements each handler call, RGB off when reaches 0
   - Guard clause prevents underflow: `if motion_count > 0: motion_count -= 1`
   - Motion handler runs every 2 seconds (per `app.py`), so timeout = 3 × 2sec = 6 seconds
   - Simpler to understand and tune than epoch timestamp calculations

4. **Window Servo Pin Configuration:**
   - Window servo uses pin 5 (from T1.12 specification)
   - Created as `Servo(pin=5)` with named parameter
   - FR3.2 implemented: Servo closes window when moisture detected
   - Follows same pattern as door servo (pin 13) from previous sessions

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **Missing Pin Parameter in Servo Constructor:**
   - **Problem**: `TypeError: function takes 2 positional arguments but 1 were given`
   - **Root Cause**: `Servo()` called without required `pin` parameter
   - **Solution**: Changed to `Servo(pin=5)` for window servo
   - **Learning**: Python error message "2 arguments" counts `self` as first position

2. **RGB State Conflicts Between Handlers:**
   - **Problem**: Steam handler turned RGB off in else block, killing motion orange indicator
   - **Root Cause**: Multiple handlers competing for same output without priority system
   - **Solution**: Removed `rgb.off()` from handler else blocks; use flash for temporary indicators
   - **Future**: T1.29 will implement proper state machine with event priority (gas > steam > motion)

3. **Duplicate Print in TimeSync:**
   - **Problem**: User saw "Time synchronized successfully" printed twice
   - **Root Cause**: Print statement in `sync_time()` method AND in `system_init.py` caller
   - **Solution**: Removed print from method, added `return True` for proper boolean status
   - **Learning**: Methods returning status shouldn't print success messages - let caller handle display

4. **Motion Handler Decrement Logic Bug:**
   - **Problem**: Initial code decremented counter twice (lines 45 and 47)
   - **Root Cause**: Decrement before guard clause, then again inside clause
   - **Solution**: Removed line 45, kept only guarded decrement inside `if motion_count > 0`
   - **Learning**: Guard clauses protect state variables from invalid transitions (e.g., negative counters)

### Key Learning Moments

**Event-Driven Systems & State Management:**
- Multiple event handlers controlling same output creates conflicts
- Quick fix: Only turn outputs ON, never OFF (works for simple cases)
- Proper solution: State machine with priority levels (T1.29 task)
- Pattern appears in interrupt handlers, RTOS scheduling, embedded control systems

**Counter vs Timestamp for Timeouts:**
- Counter-based: Intuitive ("10 loops = 5 seconds"), easy to tune, no time calculations
- Timestamp-based: More accurate, but requires understanding epoch time and conversions
- For student projects: Simpler > more accurate (easier to understand and debug)

**Guard Clauses for State Management:**
- `if counter > 0: counter -= 1` prevents underflow (counter going negative)
- `if counter < MAX: counter += 1` prevents overflow
- Without guards, state drifts into invalid ranges causing bugs
- Common in battery indicators, retry counters, animation frames, debounce timers

**Polling Intervals vs Response Time:**
- Faster polling (every 1 sec): More responsive, more CPU/power usage
- Slower polling (every 5 sec): Lower power, coarser timeout control
- Motion: 2 second polling is good balance (feels instant, not wasteful)
- Steam: 10 second polling acceptable (not time-critical)

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `esp32/handlers/steam_handler.py` - SteamHandler class with flash RGB and window control (29 lines)

**Modified:**
- `esp32/handlers/motion_handler.py` - Added counter timeout (3 loops = 6 seconds), added RGB orange, removed rgb.off()
- `esp32/handlers/steam_handler.py` - Fixed servo pin parameter, removed rgb.off() conflict
- `esp32/utils/time_sync.py` - Removed duplicate print, added return True for success
- `esp32/app.py` - Integrated steam handler, runs every 10 seconds
- `planning/tasks.md` - Marked T1.21 complete

### Architecture Impact

**Handler Pattern Proven:**
- Lighting, Motion, Steam handlers all follow same pattern
- Ultra-lazy loading working perfectly (memory stable 85-90KB)
- Handlers are stateless processors receiving `mqtt` parameter
- Pattern is repeatable for remaining tasks (gas, RFID, environment)

**Next handlers to implement:**
- T1.22 (Gas): `GasHandler` - Turn on fan, set RGB red, log to `gas_alerts` table
- T1.23 (RFID): `RFIDHandler` - Scan cards, check authorization, control door servo
- Then T1.29: Implement state machine to handle RGB priority properly

### Next Session

- Continue with **T1.22**: Gas detection & emergency response
- Create `handlers/gas_handler.py` following established pattern
- Implement: Poll gas sensor → turn on fan → set RGB solid red → log to `gas_alerts` table
- Fan runs until sensor clears, then log end time
- Expected memory: Stable ~85-90KB

## Session 18 - October 12, 2025 - Gas Detection Handler & Test Infrastructure ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.5 - Core Automation Logic (US1-US5)
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.22**: Implement gas detection & emergency response (FR4.1, FR4.2, FR4.3, FR4.4 - HOUSE/DATABASE)
  - Created `GasHandler` class with stateful alarm tracking
  - Implemented full state machine: detection → alarm active → gas cleared → alarm off
  - Added MQTT publish for both detection and clearing events
  - Created handler tests with WiFi initialization
  - Integrated into main app loop (polling every 10 seconds)

### Decisions Made

1. **State Management in Handlers:**
   - Added `self.gas_alarm_active` boolean to track alarm lifecycle
   - Pattern: Track "are we in alert mode?" to prevent duplicate activations
   - Chose simple boolean over alert_id approach for Phase 1 (can enhance in T1.29)
   - Keeps handler stateful but simpler than database-tracking approach

2. **Where State Belongs - Sensor vs Handler:**
   - **Sensors remain stateless** - Just read hardware, return current value
   - **Handlers are stateful** - Track context, decide actions, orchestrate components
   - Separation of concerns: Sensor = "What is gas value?" Handler = "What should I do about it?"
   - Keeps sensors reusable and testable in isolation

3. **Gas Handler State Machine:**
   ```
   State 1 (No alarm): gas detected → Activate (fan on, RGB red, DB insert, MQTT)
   State 2 (Alarm active): gas still detected → Do nothing (keep running)
   State 3 (Alarm active): gas cleared → Deactivate (fan off, RGB off, MQTT clear)
   State 4 (No alarm): no gas → Do nothing (normal state)
   ```

4. **Polling Interval for Gas Detection:**
   - Chose **10 seconds** (same as steam)
   - Safety-critical but sensor is reliable enough for 10s intervals
   - Trade-off: Could be 2-5 seconds for faster response, but 10s acceptable for Phase 1
   - Can adjust in T1.29 when implementing priority system

5. **Test Infrastructure Improvements:**
   - Added WiFi initialization to ALL handler tests (motion, steam, gas)
   - Pattern: WiFi → MQTT → Handler instantiation → Test loop
   - Fixes ENOTCONN errors (MQTT requires WiFi)
   - Makes tests actually verify network communication

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **MQTT Connection Failures in Tests:**
   - **Problem**: Tests showed error `-202` and `ENOTCONN` (not connected)
   - **Root Cause**: Handler tests connected MQTT without WiFi first
   - **Solution**: Added `WiFiManager().connect()` before `mqtt.connect()` in all handler tests
   - **Learning**: MQTT and Supabase both require WiFi - must initialize in correct order

2. **Logic Flow Bug - Alarm Never Deactivates:**
   - **Problem**: First implementation only had activation logic, no deactivation
   - **Root Cause**: Missing `else` block to check if alarm is currently active
   - **Solution**: Added nested if/else to handle all 4 state combinations
   - **Learning**: State machines need both transitions: inactive→active AND active→inactive

3. **Missing MQTT Clear Message:**
   - **Problem**: Web dashboard wouldn't know when gas cleared
   - **Root Cause**: Only published `{"detected": true}`, never `{"detected": false}`
   - **Solution**: Added MQTT publish when gas clears with "Gas cleared" message
   - **Learning**: Always publish state changes, not just events (both edges matter)

4. **Debug Output for Testing:**
   - **Problem**: Test ran silently, couldn't see what was happening
   - **Root Cause**: No print statements in "do nothing" branches
   - **Solution**: Added prints for all 4 states (no gas, gas detected, still detected, cleared)
   - **Learning**: Debug prints in every code path make testing easier

### Key Learning Moments

**Stateful vs Stateless Design:**
- Sensors: Stateless hardware abstraction (just read pins)
- Handlers: Stateful business logic (remember context, decide actions)
- Analogy: Thermometer (sensor) vs Thermostat (handler with set point memory)
- Keeps architecture clean and components reusable

**State Machine Design Pattern:**
- Gas alarm is a 2-state system: `inactive` and `active`
- Each state has different behaviors based on sensor input
- Must handle ALL combinations: (state × input) matrix
- Missing any combination = incomplete logic = bugs

**Test-Driven Development Benefits:**
- Student created isolated handler tests BEFORE integration
- Much faster iteration than testing in main loop
- Can trigger specific scenarios without physical sensors
- Catches bugs before deploying to hardware

**Safety-Critical Features:**
- Gas detection is life-threatening (not just convenience)
- Polling intervals matter: 60s too slow, 10s acceptable, 2s ideal
- Real-world analogy: Smoke detectors check continuously
- Phase 1: 10s acceptable, can optimize in T1.29

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `esp32/handlers/gas_handler.py` - GasHandler class with stateful alarm tracking (41 lines)
- `esp32/tests/handlers/test_gas_handler.py` - Gas handler test with WiFi initialization

**Modified:**
- `esp32/app.py` - Added gas handler to main loop (polls every 10 seconds)
- `esp32/comms/supabase.py` - Already had `insert_gas_alert()` method (lines 83-103)
- `esp32/tests/handlers/test_motion_handler.py` - Added WiFi initialization
- `esp32/tests/handlers/test_steam_handler.py` - Added WiFi initialization
- `planning/tasks.md` - Marked T1.22 complete

### Architecture Impact

**Handler Pattern Consistency:**
- All handlers now follow same pattern: Lighting, Motion, Steam, Gas
- All use stateful class instances (motion_count, gas_alarm_active, etc.)
- All use ultra-lazy loading (import inside method, delete after use)
- Memory stable at 95KB (confirmed in gas handler test output)

**Testing Infrastructure Established:**
- `esp32/tests/handlers/` - Isolated handler tests
- `esp32/tests/sensors/` - Sensor validation tests
- Pattern: Test each layer independently before integration
- Professional practice: Unit tests → Integration tests → System tests

**Next Handler: RFID (T1.23)**
- Will follow same pattern: RFIDHandler class with state if needed
- More complex: Needs to query Supabase for card validation
- Will handle: Unknown card rejection, known card door opening, database logging

### Next Session

- Continue with **T1.23**: RFID access control
- Create `handlers/rfid_handler.py` following established pattern
- Implement: Scan cards → query `authorised_cards` → door/buzzer/RGB response
- Challenge: Query database for validation (read operation, not just insert)
- Expected memory: Stable ~95KB

---

## Session 19 - October 12, 2025 - RFID Access Control Handler ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.5 - Core Automation Logic (US1-US5)
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.23**: Implement RFID access control (FR5.1-FR5.5 - HOUSE/DATABASE)
  - Created `RFIDHandler` class with database query integration
  - Implemented `Supabase.get_card_result()` method with REST API filtering
  - Granted access: Green RGB, door opens, "ACCESS GRANTED" on LCD
  - Denied access: Red RGB, buzzer beeps, "ACCESS DENIED" on LCD
  - Logs all scans to `rfid_scans` table with card_id and authorised_card_id
  - Publishes MQTT with card_id and access result (granted/denied)
  - Integrated into main app loop (polls every 2 seconds)
  - Created test file structure (hardware testing blocked - no RFID available)

### Decisions Made

1. **Supabase Query Pattern with REST API Filtering:**
   - Query URL: `/authorised_cards?card_id=eq.{card_id}&is_active=eq.true`
   - PostgREST filter syntax: `?field=eq.value&field2=eq.value2`
   - Returns list of matching records, even if only one match: `[{...}]`
   - Empty result is empty list: `[]`
   - Check length and return first item or None
   - **Why filtering matters**: Without filter, downloads entire table (wasteful bandwidth/memory)

2. **HTTP Response Resource Management:**
   - Critical order: Read data FIRST, then close connection
   - Pattern: `response.json()` → `response.close()` → `return data`
   - Closing before reading = data lost (like closing a book before reading the page)
   - Prevents memory leaks on ESP32's limited RAM

3. **RFID Handler Logic Flow:**
   - Scan card → Query database → Check if record exists
   - If card_record exists: Access granted path (green, door, LCD)
   - If card_record is None: Access denied path (red, buzzer, LCD)
   - Log ALL scans regardless of result (audit trail requirement FR5.4)
   - MQTT payload includes card_id for web dashboard display

4. **RFID Polling Interval:**
   - Chose **2 seconds** (faster than gas/steam)
   - Balance: Responsive access control vs not overwhelming database queries
   - Security feature = should feel quick to users
   - Can adjust in T1.29 if needed

5. **Future Improvements Documented (Not Implemented):**
   - RGB/Buzzer cleanup: Currently stay on indefinitely, should auto-off after 3s
   - Door auto-close: Opens but doesn't close, should close after 5s
   - Requires non-blocking timing pattern (can't use `time.sleep()` in main loop)
   - Deferred to T1.23.1 (future enhancement)

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **Query Method Returns All Cards (No Filter):**
   - **Problem**: Initial `get_card_result()` fetched entire `authorised_cards` table
   - **Root Cause**: Missing URL query parameters
   - **Solution**: Added `?card_id=eq.{card_id}&is_active=eq.true` filter to URL
   - **Learning**: REST API filtering reduces bandwidth and improves ESP32 performance

2. **Response.close() Before Response.json() Bug:**
   - **Problem**: Student closed HTTP response before reading JSON data
   - **Root Cause**: Incorrect order of operations (close → read instead of read → close)
   - **Solution**: Reordered to `cards = response.json()` → `response.close()`
   - **Learning**: Always consume response data before releasing network buffer

3. **Variable Name Mismatch (result vs card_record):**
   - **Problem**: Line 31 referenced `card_record['id']` but variable was named `result`
   - **Root Cause**: Inconsistent naming during refactoring
   - **Solution**: Renamed variable to `card_record` for clarity
   - **Learning**: Descriptive names prevent bugs (card_record > result > data)

4. **Missing time Import in Test File:**
   - **Problem**: Test used `time.sleep(1)` without importing time
   - **Root Cause**: Copy-paste from other test files, forgot import
   - **Solution**: Added `import time` to test file
   - **Learning**: Always verify imports when copying code patterns

5. **No Physical RFID for Testing:**
   - **Problem**: Can't test actual card scanning on hardware
   - **Solution**: Created test file structure, documented T1.23.2 as blocked
   - **Workaround**: Logic is sound, will test when RFID hardware available
   - **Learning**: Document blockers clearly so future sessions know what's pending

### Key Learning Moments

**REST API Query Filtering:**
- Supabase uses PostgREST syntax for filtering: `?column=operator.value`
- Common operators: `eq` (equals), `gt` (greater than), `lt` (less than)
- Multiple filters with `&`: `?field1=eq.value1&field2=eq.value2`
- Returns JSON array of matching rows (even single match is `[{...}]`)
- Critical for IoT: Filter server-side to reduce data transfer

**Resource Management on Constrained Devices:**
- HTTP responses hold network buffers in memory
- Must close connections to free resources
- Order matters: consume data → close connection → process data
- ESP32 has ~100KB RAM, every byte counts

**Database Query vs Insert Patterns:**
- Inserts: POST with JSON body → 201 Created → close
- Queries: GET with URL params → 200 OK → parse JSON → close → return data
- Queries return arrays, inserts return success boolean
- Both need error handling (network failures, invalid responses)

**Student's Learning Progress:**
- Tackled first database READ operation (previous tasks were only writes)
- Successfully debugged order-of-operations bug independently
- Understood REST API filtering concept quickly
- Good instinct to document future improvements instead of over-engineering

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `esp32/handlers/rfid_handler.py` - RFIDHandler class with database query (43 lines)
- `esp32/tests/handlers/test_rfid_handler.py` - RFID handler test file (25 lines)

**Modified:**
- `esp32/comms/supabase.py` - Added `get_card_result(card_id)` query method (lines 60-77)
- `esp32/app.py` - Added RFID handler to main loop (polls every 2 seconds, lines 19, 25, 46-48)
- `planning/tasks.md` - Marked T1.23 complete, added T1.23.1-T1.23.3 for future work

### Architecture Impact

**First Database READ Operation:**
- Previous handlers only INSERT data (motion_events, gas_alerts, sensor_logs)
- RFID handler QUERIES database before deciding action
- Pattern established: Query → Process → Act → Log
- Opens door for other read operations (user lookups, historical queries)

**Supabase Client Enhancement:**
- Added query capability alongside existing insert methods
- Pattern: `get_*` methods return data or None, `insert_*` methods return boolean
- Memory efficient: Close responses immediately after reading
- Can be extended for other queries (authorised users, device config, etc.)

**Handler Polling Strategy:**
- Lighting: 60s (time-based, no urgency)
- Motion: 5s (security, moderate urgency)
- Gas: 10s (safety-critical but sensor reliable)
- Steam: 10s (convenience feature)
- RFID: 2s (security + user experience, should feel responsive)

**Complete Handler Pattern Now Established:**
1. Import dependencies inside method (ultra-lazy loading)
2. Instantiate sensors/outputs
3. Read sensor state
4. Query database if needed (NEW with RFID)
5. Decide action based on business logic
6. Execute outputs (RGB, servo, buzzer, LCD)
7. Log to database
8. Publish MQTT for real-time updates
9. Delete objects and collect garbage
10. Memory profiling after each handler run

### Next Session

- **Start Milestone 1.6**: Environmental Monitoring (US6, US7)
- Begin with **T1.24**: Continuous temperature/humidity display
  - Read DHT11 every 2 seconds
  - Display on LCD: "Temp: 24.5C / Humid: 60%"
  - Publish to MQTT: `home/temperature` and `home/humidity`
  - Should be straightforward - DHT11 sensor class already implemented (T1.5)
- Then **T1.25**: 30-minute sensor logging
  - Timer-based database inserts
  - Use `sensor_logs` table
- Finally **T1.26**: Asthma alert system
  - Conditional logic: humidity > 50% AND temp > 27°C
  - Display "ASTHMA ALERT" on LCD
  - Publish to MQTT: `home/asthma_alert`

---

## Session 20 - October 12, 2025 - Environment Handler with JSON MQTT Payloads ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.6 - Environmental Monitoring (US6, US7)
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.24**: Implement continuous temperature/humidity display (FR6.1, FR6.2, FR6.3 - HOUSE/WEB)
  - Created `EnvironmentHandler` class with DHT11 sensor integration
  - Student initially implemented with raw number MQTT publishing
  - Reviewed and identified two critical issues: missing JSON format and no error handling
  - Fixed MQTT payloads to use JSON format: `{"value": 24.5, "unit": "C"}`
  - Added sensor read error handling (return early if DHT11 returns None)
  - Integrated into app.py main loop (polls every 2 seconds)
  - LCD displays: "Temp: XXC / Humid: XX%"
  - Publishes to `home/temperature` and `home/humidity` MQTT topics

### Decisions Made

1. **Maintained Modular Handler Pattern:**
   - Student asked excellent architecture question: "Should this be in handlers/ folder?"
   - Confirmed: Yes - consistency with lighting/motion/gas/steam/rfid handlers
   - Pattern: main.py orchestrates → app.py event loop → handlers/ automation logic
   - Benefits: lazy-loading, memory management, maintainability

2. **MQTT Payload Format - JSON Required:**
   - **Student's initial approach**: Published raw numbers `mqtt.publish("home/temperature", 24.5)`
   - **Problem**: Web dashboard (Next.js) expects structured JSON for parsing
   - **Solution**: Use `json.dumps({"value": temp, "unit": "C"})` format
   - **Why it matters**: Phase 3 web dashboard will subscribe and parse these messages
   - **Learning moment**: Data contracts between systems must be explicit

3. **Error Handling for Sensor Failures:**
   - **Student's initial code**: No None check after `dht11.read_data()`
   - **Problem**: DHT11 can fail (timeout, wiring), returns `(None, None)`
   - **Impact**: Calling `oled.show_temp_humidity(None, None)` would crash system
   - **Solution**: Early return pattern with memory cleanup on error
   - **Defensive programming**: Always validate sensor readings before using

4. **Environment Polling Interval - 2 Seconds:**
   - Same as RFID handler (responsive user experience)
   - Faster than gas/steam (10s), slower than per-second loops
   - DHT11 sensor has ~2 second internal measurement cycle, so matches hardware

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **MQTT Payload Format Missing (Student Code Review):**
   - **Issue**: Student implemented `mqtt.publish("home/temperature", temperature)` without JSON
   - **Root Cause**: Worked for testing (MQTT accepts any payload), but wrong for web integration
   - **Resolution**: Added `import json` and formatted payloads with `json.dumps()`
   - **Learning**: Test-driven development can miss integration requirements if not thinking ahead

2. **No Error Handling for Sensor Read Failures:**
   - **Issue**: No check if `temperature is None or humidity is None`
   - **Root Cause**: Student focused on happy path (sensor working correctly)
   - **Resolution**: Added early return with cleanup if sensor fails
   - **Learning**: IoT systems must handle sensor failures gracefully (24/7 operation)

3. **Filename Typo (Minor):**
   - **Issue**: Student created `enviroment_handler.py` (missing 'n')
   - **Resolution**: Noted but not critical - maintained consistency with student's spelling
   - **Decision**: Don't break working code for spelling - can refactor later

### Key Learning Moments

**Data Contracts Between Systems:**
- ESP32 publishes → MQTT broker → Next.js subscribes
- Both sides must agree on message format (JSON with `value` and `unit` keys)
- Breaking this contract = silent failures (messages arrive but can't be parsed)
- Document MQTT topic formats in `planning/architecture.md` for reference

**Defensive Programming on Constrained Devices:**
- ESP32 runs 24/7 with ~100KB RAM - can't afford crashes
- Sensor failures are normal (electromagnetic interference, loose wiring, age)
- Pattern: Read sensor → Validate result → Use data → Cleanup
- Early returns prevent cascading failures down the handler chain

**Consistency in Architecture:**
- Student questioned handler placement - shows good architectural thinking
- Consistency > perfection: All automation logic goes in `handlers/`
- Breaking patterns creates technical debt and confusion for future developers
- Established patterns make codebase predictable and maintainable

**Student's Progress:**
- Asked clarifying architecture question before implementing (excellent instinct)
- Successfully tested on hardware independently
- Receptive to code review feedback and understood the "why" behind fixes
- Growing understanding of system integration (not just isolated modules)

### Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
- `esp32/handlers/enviroment_handler.py` - EnvironmentHandler class (36 lines)
- `esp32/tests/handlers/test_enviroment_handler.py` - Test file (25 lines)

**Modified:**
- `esp32/handlers/enviroment_handler.py` - Added JSON formatting and error handling (reviewed/fixed)
- `esp32/app.py` - Added environment handler import and 2-second polling (lines 20, 27, 52-54)
- `planning/tasks.md` - Marked T1.24 complete with dates

### Architecture Impact

**Complete Environmental Monitoring Pipeline:**
- DHT11 sensor → Handler reads every 2s → LCD displays → MQTT publishes
- Ready for Phase 3: Next.js can subscribe to `home/temperature` and `home/humidity`
- JSON format enables web dashboard to display live sensor data

**Handler Pattern Evolution:**
- Lighting: Time-based (60s polling)
- Motion: Event-driven with database logging (5s polling)
- Gas: Stateful alarm with database start/end tracking (10s polling)
- Steam: Window control automation (10s polling)
- RFID: Database query for access control (2s polling)
- **Environment (NEW)**: Continuous monitoring with real-time display + MQTT (2s polling)

**All handler patterns now demonstrated:**
- Time-based triggers (lighting)
- Event detection (motion, gas, steam)
- Database READ operations (RFID)
- Database WRITE operations (motion, gas, RFID)
- Output control (all handlers)
- LCD display (RFID, environment)
- MQTT publishing (all event handlers)

### Next Session

- **Start T1.25**: Implement 30-minute sensor logging (FR6.4 - DATABASE)
  - Timer-based database inserts for temperature/humidity
  - Insert to `sensor_logs` table every 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
  - Use `loop_count % 1800 == 0` pattern in app.py
  - Call `Supabase.insert_sensor_log()` method (already implemented in T1.18)
  - Test by adjusting timer to shorter interval (e.g., 60s for testing)
- Then **T1.26**: Asthma alert system (FR7.1, FR7.2, FR7.3)
  - Conditional logic: `humidity > 50 AND temperature > 27`
  - Display "ASTHMA ALERT" on LCD
  - Publish to `home/asthma_alert` MQTT topic
  - Should be quick - reuses environment handler's sensor readings

## Session 6 - 2025-10-14 - MQTT-Only Architecture Refactor ✅

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Embedded System Core
**Milestone**: 1.5 - MQTT Architecture Migration
**Branch**: phase-1-embedded-core

### Tasks Completed

- [x] **T1.17** (partial): Removed Supabase HTTP client - MQTT-only architecture
- [x] **T1.18**: Deprecated Supabase module - removed all direct HTTP database access
- [x] **Configuration Cleanup**: Updated config.py and config.example.py with MQTT topic structure
- [x] **Gas Handler**: Refactored to MQTT-only, added fan status publishing (FR8.5)
- [x] **Environment Handler**: Refactored to MQTT-only, consolidated with database_log_handler
- [x] **Motion Handler**: Refactored to MQTT-only, removed door status publishing bug
- [x] **Steam Handler**: Refactored with non-blocking flash pattern, added window status publishing (FR8.4)
- [x] **RGB Output Class**: Removed blocking `flash()` method to prevent event loop freezing
- [x] **Documentation**: Removed LED control/status topics from architecture.md (not in PRD requirements)

### Decisions Made

**1. MQTT-Only Communication Pattern (Critical Architecture Change):**
- **Decision**: ESP32 communicates EXCLUSIVELY via MQTT - NO HTTP/REST calls to Supabase
- **Rationale**: MicroPython's `urequests` library causes memory leaks over time
- **Impact**: All database writes now handled by C# middleware (Phase 2)
- **Pattern**: ESP32 → MQTT publish → C# middleware subscribes → Supabase writes
- **Security**: ESP32 no longer has database credentials - centralized in C# layer

**2. Topic Structure Standardization:**
- **Pattern**: `devices/{deviceId}/{category}/{subcategory}`
- **Device ID**: `esp32_main` (scalable to multiple devices)
- **Publish Topics**: `devices/esp32_main/data` (sensors), `devices/esp32_main/rfid/check`, `devices/esp32_main/status/*` (outputs)
- **Subscribe Topics**: `devices/esp32_main/rfid/response`, `devices/esp32_main/control/*`
- **Rationale**: Aligns with MQTT best practices, clear hierarchy, wildcard support

**3. Non-Blocking Flash Pattern for RGB:**
- **Issue**: `rgb.flash()` used `time.sleep()` which froze entire event loop for 3 seconds
- **Decision**: Implemented countdown timer pattern in handlers (like motion_handler)
- **Pattern**: `flash_count = 6` (3 flashes × 2 states), decrement each loop, toggle RGB on even/odd
- **Removed**: Blocking `flash()` method from RGB class entirely
- **Applied To**: Steam handler (blue flash - FR3.3), prepared for RFID handler (red flash - FR5.3)

**4. Configuration-Driven Topic Management:**
- **Decision**: Centralize all MQTT topics in `config.py` as constants
- **Pattern**: `TOPIC_SENSOR_DATA`, `TOPIC_STATUS_FAN`, `TOPIC_RFID_REQUEST`, etc.
- **Added Comments**: FR references for traceability (e.g., "# For web dashboard display - FR8.4, FR8.5")
- **Removed**: LED status/control topics (not in PRD requirements FR8-FR9)

**5. Output Status Publishing:**
- **Decision**: Handlers must publish output state changes to status topics
- **Implemented**: Gas handler publishes fan status, steam handler publishes window status
- **Purpose**: Enables web dashboard to display output states (FR8.4, FR8.5)
- **Pattern**: Publish to `devices/esp32_main/status/{output}` with payload `{"state": "on/off/open/closed", "timestamp": "..."}`

**6. Consolidation of Duplicate Handlers:**
- **Discovery**: `database_log_handler.py` and `environment_handler.py` both read DHT11
- **Decision**: Keep `environment_handler.py` (displays on OLED + publishes MQTT), delete `database_log_handler.py`
- **Rationale**: C# middleware handles database writes, no need for separate "log" handler
- **Student Insight**: "I am pretty sure that the c# api will be handling all of the database posting" - excellent architectural thinking!

**7. PRD-Driven Feature Removal:**
- **Analyzed**: LED control/status not in PRD requirements (FR8.4, FR8.5, FR9.1-9.3 only mention door/window/fan)
- **Decision**: Removed `TOPIC_STATUS_LED` and `TOPIC_CONTROL_LED` from config and architecture.md
- **Principle**: YAGNI - only implement what's required, avoid feature creep
- **Updated**: Architecture.md to match PRD exactly (documentation drift correction)

### Issues Encountered

**1. Blocking RGB Flash Discovered by Student:**
- **Issue**: Student noticed steam_handler used `rgb.flash()` with blocking `time.sleep()` in tight event loop
- **Root Cause**: RGB class method froze system for 3 seconds during flash animation
- **Impact**: Motion detection, gas detection, RFID scanning all stopped during flash
- **Resolution**: Implemented non-blocking countdown timer pattern across all handlers
- **Learning**: Single-threaded event loops require non-blocking patterns - student recognized this independently!

**2. Door Status in Motion Handler (Bug):**
- **Issue**: Motion handler was publishing door status to `TOPIC_STATUS_DOOR` - incorrect logic
- **Root Cause**: Undocumented feature creep - motion detection doesn't control door
- **Resolution**: Removed door status publishing, only RGB orange and MQTT sensor data remain
- **Lesson**: Always check PRD - if feature isn't documented, it's probably wrong

**3. Inconsistent MQTT Topics:**
- **Issue**: Old handlers used `home/*` topics, new architecture uses `devices/esp32_main/*`
- **Resolution**: Updated all handlers to use topic constants from config.py
- **Pattern**: Import topics from config: `from config import TOPIC_SENSOR_DATA, TOPIC_STATUS_FAN`

**4. Missing RFID Request/Response Pattern:**
- **Issue**: RFID handler doesn't implement MQTT request/response flow with C# middleware
- **Current**: Handler validates ANY card as granted (no database check)
- **Required**: Publish UID to `rfid/check`, wait for response on `rfid/response`, react to validation
- **Status**: Identified but not completed this session - requires subscription callback setup
- **Next Session**: Major refactor needed for RFID (most complex handler)

**5. Motion Handler Countdown Timer Naming Confusion:**
- **Issue**: Student had `motion_count = 3` countdown but loop runs every 1 second (not 1/3 second)
- **Resolution**: Countdown of 3 = RGB stays on for 3 loop iterations = 3 seconds total
- **Learning**: Non-blocking timers work at loop frequency, not absolute time

### Key Learning Moments

**Separation of Concerns - RGB Flash Logic:**
- **Question**: "Could I write a flash method into rgb without using time?"
- **Discussion**: Technically yes (add update() method), but architecturally wrong
- **Principle**: RGB class should control hardware ONLY, not manage application state/timing
- **Insight**: Handler owns business logic (when to flash), RGB owns hardware control (set color)
- **Alternative Considered**: FlashTimer utility class for reusability
- **Conclusion**: YAGNI applies - only 2-3 handlers flash, duplication is minimal

**Documentation as Source of Truth:**
- **Discovery**: architecture.md included LED topics, but PRD doesn't require them
- **Learning**: When docs conflict, PRD wins (it's the contract for assessment)
- **Action**: Updated architecture.md to remove LED, aligned with PRD requirements
- **Insight**: Documentation drift is common - design docs from early project phases become stale

**Request/Response in Pub/Sub Systems:**
- **Challenge**: MQTT is publish/subscribe, not request/response like HTTP
- **Pattern**: Publish request to one topic, subscribe to response topic, match via correlation
- **ESP32 Limitation**: Can't maintain HTTP connections, so MQTT becomes transport layer
- **Architecture**: RFID check/response uses this pattern with C# middleware as validator

**Memory Management in Event Loops:**
- **Pattern**: Lazy load dependencies inside handler methods
- **Cleanup**: Delete objects after use, run garbage collection
- **Rationale**: ESP32 has ~100KB RAM - can't keep all objects in memory permanently
- **Student Applied**: Correctly added `time_sync` to all `del` statements after review

**PRD-Driven Development:**
- **Student Question**: "Is it a functional requirement that if motion is detected then the door needs to close?"
- **Process**: Checked PRD (US2, FR2.1-2.3) - no door control mentioned
- **Learning**: When uncertain about features, consult PRD - it's the requirements contract
- **Prevented**: Implementing unnecessary features, kept scope focused

### Architecture Impact

**Complete MQTT-Only Migration:**
- ✅ Gas handler: MQTT sensor data + fan status
- ✅ Environment handler: MQTT temp/humidity data
- ✅ Motion handler: MQTT motion events
- ✅ Steam handler: MQTT steam detection + window status
- ⚠️ RFID handler: Needs request/response pattern implementation (next session)
- ❌ Removed: All Supabase HTTP client code (`esp32/comms/supabase.py` and subdirectory)

**Handler Status Publishing Compliance:**
- ✅ Fan status published by gas_handler (FR8.5)
- ✅ Window status published by steam_handler (FR8.4)
- ✅ Door status will be published by RFID handler (FR8.4) - pending refactor
- ❌ LED status removed (not in PRD)

**Non-Blocking Patterns Established:**
- ✅ Motion handler: Countdown timer for RGB orange
- ✅ Steam handler: Non-blocking blue flash (6-state countdown)
- ⚠️ RFID handler: Needs non-blocking red flash (next session)
- ✅ RGB class: Removed blocking flash() method entirely

**Configuration Management:**
- ✅ All MQTT topics centralized in config.py
- ✅ Topic constants imported by handlers
- ✅ FR references added as comments for traceability
- ✅ Documentation (architecture.md) aligned with config.py and PRD

### Files Modified This Session

**Configuration:**
- `esp32/config.py` - Removed LED topics, added FR comments
- `esp32/config.example.py` - Matched changes to config.py

**Handlers (Refactored):**
- `esp32/handlers/gas_handler.py` - MQTT-only, fan status publishing
- `esp32/handlers/environment_handler.py` - MQTT-only, consolidated with database logger
- `esp32/handlers/motion_handler.py` - MQTT-only, removed door status bug
- `esp32/handlers/steam_handler.py` - Non-blocking flash, window status publishing
- `esp32/handlers/database_log_handler.py` - Deprecated (functionality moved to environment_handler)

**Outputs:**
- `esp32/outputs/rgb.py` - Removed blocking flash() method

**Documentation:**
- `planning/architecture.md` - Removed LED topics from status/control sections, aligned with PRD

**Removed:**
- ❌ `esp32/comms/supabase.py` - No longer needed (MQTT-only)
- ❌ `esp32/comms/supabase/` directory - All modules deleted (gas_alerts.py, motion_events.py, rfid_scans.py, rfid_results.py, sensor_logs.py)

### Next Session Priorities

**High Priority - RFID Handler Refactor:**
1. Implement MQTT request/response pattern (FR5.1, FR5.2)
   - Publish card UID to `devices/esp32_main/rfid/check`
   - Subscribe to `devices/esp32_main/rfid/response` (requires callback setup)
   - Wait for C# middleware validation result
   - React based on `valid: true/false`

2. Add non-blocking red flash for denied access (FR5.3)
   - Countdown timer pattern: `flash_count = 6`
   - Red flash + buzzer on invalid card

3. Publish door status after servo movement (FR8.4)
   - `devices/esp32_main/status/door` with `{"state": "open"/"closed"}`

**Medium Priority - MQTT Subscription Setup:**
- Configure MQTT client to subscribe to `devices/esp32_main/rfid/response`
- Implement callback routing in mqtt_client.py or app.py
- Handle incoming validation responses in RFID handler

**Low Priority - Cleanup:**
- Remove `database_log_handler.py` import from app.py (line 22)
- Test end-to-end flow with all refactored handlers
- Update tasks.md with completed architecture refactor milestones

**Preparation Needed:**
- Review architecture.md RFID flow (Pattern 4, lines 97-115)
- Understand MQTT subscription callback patterns
- Plan state management for "pending validation" in RFID handler

### Session Statistics
